Artler briefly discusses her childhood in Poland, noting her\n              father's occupation as a butcher, before moving on to describe her memories of her\n              initial years in New York City living in the back of her father's butcher shop. As\n              business declined in their initial location, Artler recalls the way in which her\n              family moved throughout the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.\n              Artler specifically notes that they moved to better themselves, whether through better\n              rent or living arrangements. She briefly describes her three years of school, placing\n              more emphasis on the various jobs she held in garment factories making feather hat\n              ornaments, children's dresses, and the fronts of ladies' dresses. She describes the\n              conditions of the factories in which she worked as being acceptable, neither\n              exceptionally dirty or crowded. She mentions the worker demographic as being split\n              between Italians and Jews and that the two groups got along well within the workspace.\n              She notes the delineation of work between men, women, and children and the tension\n              between the manager and the employees due to his extravagant lifestyle. Artler notes\n              that while she originally gave all of her wages to her parents in an effort to augment\n              the household's income, she eventually contested this agreement and kept more of the\n              money she earned. She discusses her membership in an unspecified union (likely the\n              International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union) and her participation in strikes for\n              higher wages, shorter work weeks, and greater job security, all of which the union\n              eventually succeeded in acquiring. She recounts participating in union sponsored\n              social events in order to stay informed about her community and going to movies and\n              shows with the circle of friends that she made through the union. Summary is available\n              for this interview."

The date and location are unknown.\n              This interview covers Morris Bagno's childhood in Poland; his immigration to various\n              European countries before, during, and after World War I; his immigration to Canada\n              and the United States (US); and his life and work in the garment industry in New York\n              and California. Bagno begins by describing his childhood in Poland, noting that the\n              industry in his town was much smaller than in the cities that he would encounter in\n              the US. He explains that he received the equivalent of a college education at his\n              local yeshiva while working with his father in the timber industry. He describes his\n              decision to leave Poland in 1912 in order to avoid conscription into the army and to\n              escape his father's orthodox Judaism. He recalls his immigration to various countries\n              in which he lived including England, Belgium, Denmark, and Canada before his\n              immigration to the US in 1920. He recounts the awe he felt at seeing skyscrapers upon\n              his arrival in New York City, which formed a stark contrast to the rural town where he\n              grew up. He recounts working with his uncle for a short time before deciding to find a\n              job on his own and his his uncle's belief that he was indebted to and dependent upon\n              him. He recalls joining the local chapter of the International Ladies' Garment\n              Workers' Union, which he remarked was special for its inclusion of women as members\n              and the fact that women could hold high positions within the union leadership. He\n              discusses his progression from a tailor to union delegate to supervisor and liaison\n              between workers and employers. He mentions that he made sure to keep his home life and\n              his work life separate as he did not want his wife becoming involved in union affairs\n              or interfering in his affairs. He notes that the passage of the Norris-La Guardia Act\n              in 1932 and the National Labor Relations Act in 1935 mitigated the effects of the\n              Great Depression by preventing lockouts and allowing for unionization. He recalls\n              temporarily relocating to Los Angeles, California in 1949 at the behest of the\n              president of the union in order to deal with the rising tension in one of the locals\n              between the Social Democrats faction, of which he was a member, and the Communist\n              faction, who were viewed as dangerous to the union."

This interview covers Abraham Belson's childhood in Russia;\n              his immigration to the United States (US); and his life and work in the garment\n              industry in Massachusetts and New York. Belson begins by describing part of his\n              father's history, recounting a time when the Russian government forced the Jewish\n              population to convert to a religion other than Judaism and his father's refusal and\n              subsequent draft into the army for fifteen years. Belson recounts his membership in an\n              unspecified Jewish club (likely the General Jewish Labour Bund of Lithuania, Poland\n              and Russia) aligned against the czar and the feeling that he had to work against an\n              authority that was not concerned with his well-being. He describes immigrating to the\n              US; living briefly in Massachusetts; and moving to New York City where his family and\n              many friends from his hometown lived. He spends the rest of the interview focused on\n              the happenings of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), which he\n              joined in 1907. He mentions an unsuccessful strike in 1907 that lasted 13 weeks,\n              resulting in landlords evicting families from their homes when they were unable to pay\n              rent and the fact that they had to beg in the streets until the union was forced to\n              compromise. He explains that the union reorganized between 1907 and 1910 and rallied\n              for its first large general strike in 1910. Belson describes the camaraderie that he\n              felt with his fellow union members; the union events they attended together; and the\n              picnics and other outings they had during their free time. He notes that this was\n              common in several tight-knit communities in Brooklyn, Bronxville, and other parts of\n              New York that were populated predominantly by ILGWU members. He recalls becoming a\n              union officer in 1949, emphasizing that this position required that he earn the\n              respect of both workers and management in order to be elected and reelected every\n              year. Belson describes how the conditions of the workplace for garment workers\n              improved due to union influence, noting better wages, better job hours, more job\n              security, and the fact that workers were no longer required to rent their own machines\n              in order to work. He shares an anecdote about a strike in Newark, New Jersey that\n              resulted in a prolonged stalemate between management and the union and how he and\n              other union members strongarmed the management to cooperate with the union\n              liaison."

This interview covers Stella Bialon's life in Poland; her\n              immigration to the United States (US); and her husband's involvement in both an\n              unspecified hatters' union and an unspecified millinery trade union. Bialon describes\n              her childhood in Europe, noting that her family's wealth enabled her to attend school.\n              She discusses her parents' opposition to her marriage because of the economic\n              disparity between herself and her husband. She recounts that her brother owned a\n              garment business in Manhattan, New York. She explains that she came to the US in 1910\n              originally on a three month trip but stayed there permanently, later sending for her\n              husband. She describes her husband's dedication to Socialism; his position as\n              secretary and later chairman of an unspecified millinery trade union; the dishonest\n              business practices utilized by employers to monopolize both the garment industry and\n              its workers; and the contrast in freedom of speech between Poland and the US. Index is\n              available for this interview."

Antonio Buono and an\n              unidentified friend frequently converse in Italian during the interview. This\n              interview covers Buono's childhood in Italy; his immigration to the United States (US)\n              in 1934; and his life and work as a longshoreman in Brooklyn, New York. Buono begins\n              by describing his childhood on a small farm in Italy, recalling his father's\n              immigration to the US in 1902 and his sporadic visits to Italy. He recounts his and\n              his twin brother's decision to immigrate to the US and join their father in Brooklyn,\n              where Buono worked in a small provisions factory. He recounts his decision to work as\n              a longshoreman because of the flexibility of the work hours and the increase in pay.\n              He recalls that though the job was labor intensive, the fresh air, consistent hours,\n              and waterfront view made the job much more bearable than factory work. He describes\n              how joining an unspecified union (likely the International Longshoremen's Association)\n              in 1940 helped to maintain his wages and hours and explains that there were few\n              strikes during World War II in order to maintain the war effort. Buono describes the\n              relationship among the Italians in Brooklyn, many of whom were longshoremen, and notes\n              that although the immigrants from different parts of Italy could be clannish when they\n              socialized, they would present a united front in the workplace. Other topics include\n              his leisure activities and Italian traditions that were kept alive in the United\n              States."

She describes meeting and marrying her first husband in\n              Alabama despite her family's reservations about her being too young and her occupation\n              as a domestic worker for various families in Atmore, a position that she acquired from\n              her mother when the latter became ill. She spends a great deal of time discussing her\n              movement throughout the US, including moving to Cleveland, Ohio in order to find\n              domestic work to support her children, whom she had left with her parents after she\n              separated from her husband; receiving a certificate in practical nursing in Chicago,\n              Illinois; and moving to Brooklyn, New York to live with one of her sons. She recalls\n              sending much of the money she earned back to her family and writing letters to her\n              mother and children to accompany each paycheck. Clanton discusses her union\n              involvement, including being introduced to the idea of unions by organizer Jesse Olson\n              while working at Beth Israel Hospital, as a nurses' aide, in Manhattan; going to\n              various hotels in New York City for union meetings; discussing union activities with\n              co-workers only on breaks or after work; and participating in a hospital workers'\n              strike in 1959. Clanton discusses her opinion that despite the union not supporting\n              striking workers sufficiently she realized the benefits of belonging to a union; her\n              appreciation of Local 1199 after her retirement; and the educational programs and\n              social activities that Local 1199 provided."

Main topics include Ophelia Fulwood's life in North Carolina, her migration\n              north, her work as a maid, and her union activities. Fullwood recalls her early years\n              in North Carolina including being raised by her mother's cousin; giving water to the\n              workers on her grandfather's farm during the harvest season; leaving school in eighth\n              grade to work as a maid; and learning about sex. Some of her first impressions of New\n              York, New York include being shocked by the segregation in the US; not having warm\n              clothes; and being afraid to be alone in New York City. She discusses her work as a\n              maid, including her work schedule; the fact that she quit her job when her employers\n              had marital problems; and that employment opportunities often came by word of mouth.\n              When discussing her feelings on being a maid, Fulwood mentioned preferring day labor\n              over sleep-in positions; that she loved being able to control her own schedule at the\n              time of the interview; and that she was firm during the hiring process about what type\n              of work she would do and how much she should be paid for it."

The majority of this interview, covering\n              the first 25 years of Amelia Geiss' life, was not recorded. Topics covered include\n              Geiss' relationship with her husband; her experiences during the Great Depression;\n              racial and ethnic tensions in her community in New York, New York; and her work at the\n              Stanley M.

Geiss spends the majority of the interview\n              discussing her relationship with her husband, Bill, including how he was separated\n              from his first wife when they first began their relationship; the fact that his\n              estranged wife stalked Geiss; and the fact that she moved multiple times to escape\n              this harassment. She discusses her husband's work as an electrician at the Brooklyn\n              Navy Yard. She recalls that they survived the Great Depression due to the fact that\n              they both were able to work. She discusses the community she lived in at the time of\n              the interview, including how ethnic discrimination had gotten worse over time, and\n              that the community had more problems at the time of the interview because it was no\n              longer predominantly German. She discusses her volunteer work at the Stanley M. Isaacs\n              Neighborhood Center, including the fact that she joined so that she and her husband\n              would not fight after they retired; her fundraising efforts; both she and her husband\n              being recognized by New York City for their work at the Center; and her participation\n              on the Board of Directors."

The main topics\n              discussed include Rose Godet's childhood in the Dominican Republic, her feelings about\n              immigrating to the United States (US), her work experience, and her personal\n              experiences in New York, New York. Godet begins by discussing her early life in the\n              Dominican Republic, including being of French descent; speaking multiple languages;\n              and her father working for the Puccini Shipping Company. Her early experiences in New\n              York City include living on 140th Street in Manhattan; deciding to only live in\n              Manhattan; disliking living in the US initially because she had never worked before;\n              feeling lonely in the city; and finding the US to be substantially more expensive than\n              the Dominican Republic. Godet discusses her confusion regarding segregation, having\n              never witnessed white flight before coming to the US. She discusses her personal\n              experiences during the Prohibition era and the Great Depression, including an Irish\n              friend giving her bootleg liquor, though she did not like the taste; enjoying visiting\n              speakeasies; and being employed pressing silk underwear. She talks about World War II\n              and her fear of air raid drills; that minimum wage requirements implemented by\n              Franklin Roosevelt were not enforced; and her belief that the US government would pull\n              men off the streets and force them into the military. She notes her work experience,\n              which included working as a saleswoman and interpreter for the Charles Broadway Rouss\n              department store on Broadway in Manhattan and learning to type in order to work for a\n              mail order company translating orders received in Spanish or French. She discusses her\n              employment at the National Biscuit Company packing cookies after she began to lose her\n              eyesight, and feeling exploited by the company due to the minimal vacation time, long\n              hours, and low wages."

The main topics include Eddie Hochberg's\n              life in Russia; his immigration to the United States (US); his work in the garment\n              industry both in Russia and the US; and the internal organization of garment workers'\n              labor unions in New York, New York. Hochberg discusses his early life in Russia,\n              including his family's poverty and his father's work as a supervisor in a logging\n              company. He discusses the immigration of his family to the US, including his father\n              immigrating in 1911 and finding work in a paper box factory; two of his brothers\n              immigrating after their father; Hochberg immigrating alone in 1914; and the rest of\n              his family following in 1916. He describes finding his first job through a man with\n              whom he attended synagogue; not being paid for three weeks while he learned the trade;\n              and his first job turning over coats to create seams. He discusses his movement\n              through different factories within the garment industry and his work in each,\n              including manufacturing coats for men, cloaks, and dresses; being paid for both week\n              work and piecework; cleaning and oiling the machines every Friday; working overtime\n              during the busy season; and having to find other employment during the summer. He\n              describes the introduction of labor unions into the garment industry, including the\n              fact that very few companies were unionized initially; the establishment of the\n              National Recovery Administration in 1933 guaranteeing workers the right to join\n              unions; that different locals within the same international union being determined by\n              profession as well as ethnicity; and unions providing benefits such as better pay,\n              vacations, and pensions. Hochberg also mentions that he was a member of multiple\n              unions, including the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union Local 22, the\n              Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, and the United Brotherhood of Cloak Makers\n              Local 1."

The first name of the narrator is unknown. Mr. Hoffzimmer reminisces\n              about his early life and immigration to the United States (US), including his father\n              being a cobbler; his father not teaching him the trade; and falsifying his immigration\n              papers to show that he was 16 years old in order to emigrate. He discusses the\n              immigration process at Ellis Island, New York, including a required medical\n              examination; the requirement of either $25 or someone to vouch for you; and\n              immigration societies that would vouch for individuals who knew no one in New York and\n              assist them with acquiring lodgings. His first impressions of New York City include\n              not feeling excited about living in New York; the abundance of poverty; and\n              hostilities between ethnic groups, especially between the Jewish and Irish\n              communities. He discusses his involvement with Socialism and the Socialist Party of\n              America, including attending lectures and meetings at the Rand School of Social\n              Science in Manhattan; his feelings about Social Security; society's lack of\n              appreciation for social programs at the time of the interview; and reading the\n              Socialist newspaper . Hoffzimmer\n              discusses his family, including meeting his wife through friends; and sending his\n              daughter to the Workmen's Circle to learn about Jewish language and culture. He\n              discusses his great appreciation for his wife; and the accomplishments of his\n              grandson. He recalls his work experience, in particular finding employment as a hatter\n              through his work manufacturing human hair goods. He describes traveling to the western\n              US and to Mexico with the money he saved at his first job. He recounts learning\n              Spanish and opening a business selling portraits while in Mexico; and opening his own\n              hattery upon his return to New York with the money he made. He also recalls not\n              requiring government assistance during the Great Depression because of his business;\n              discusses the benefits and drawbacks of modernization; and discusses his membership in\n              the United Hatters of North America."

Levine describes his childhood in Poland,\n              recalling the various garment factories in which he worked from the age of 13. He\n              notes that he decided to immigrate to the US in order to avoid conscription into the\n              Russian Army. He explains that he first lived with his uncle in Portchester, New York\n              before moving to Cherry Street in Manhattan. He emphasizes the strong relationship\n              between himself and his wife's family that developed over the years in which he\n              boarded with them and after his marriage in 1916. He describes working as a milliner,\n              peddler, waiter, and cloakman, noting that although he initially made less money in\n              the US than he did in Poland, the work in the US was easier.

Topics in this interview include Danny Meyers' family, his experience\n              driving a taxi, and the process of unionizing taxi drivers. Meyers discusses his\n              family, including the fact that his father died when Meyers was seven; the fact that\n              his family was very religious; and the fact that his family would have prefered that\n              he had chosen a different profession. He discusses the fact that his children\n              continued to practice their Jewish faith as adults and the fact that he felt proud\n              that all of his children had graduated from college. He recollects his career driving\n              a taxi, including starting during the Great Depression so that he would not have to\n              ask for government assistance; being robbed and assaulted many times during his\n              career; and playing cards with the other taxi drivers after a shift. Meyers recounts\n              driving Fiorello La Guardia to a meeting at 3:00 in the morning and how this\n              interaction led to La Guardia being the only politician that Meyers ever supported.\n              Meyers discusses in detail multiple attempts at unionization of taxi drivers; the\n              support given by John L. Lewis, Mike Quill, and Jimmy Hoffa; the effects of these\n              attempts; and his speculation as to why they were unsuccessful until 1966. He\n              elaborates on the benefits of unionization, including no longer needing to bribe the\n              dispatcher in order to get a vehicle for the day; gaining larger commissions on each\n              fare; creating solidarity within the taxi driving community; and believing that\n              unionization was greatly beneficial to taxi drivers."

In addition to Frank Pane, there is an unknown man who\n              intermittently comments on the interviewers' questions. This interview covers Pane's\n              childhood in Italy, his immigration to the United States, and his life and work as a\n              bookbinder and longshoreman in New York, New York. Pane discusses his family history,\n              noting the contrast between his father, who was a relatively poor longshoreman, and\n              his mother, who had inherited two large homes from her parents. He recounts how his\n              father's schooner was destroyed by a steamboat while at sea and how the steamboat\n              crew, who were headed to the United States, brought him with them, and he settled in\n              New York in order to acquire more job opportunities. Pane and the rest of his family\n              immigrated to the United States later in 1898 via the ship Victoria. He describes the\n              poor living conditions that many immigrants, including his family, endured. He notes\n              that during the the depressions before and after World War I, Father Vogel at the\n              Saint Charles Chapel on Van Brunt and President Streets in Brooklyn, New York would\n              distribute food and coal tickets to poor families. He describes evading the draft\n              during World War II in order to support his family and shifting his occupation from\n              bookbinder to work as a caulker in the shipyards. He notes that he liked the work due\n              to the outdoor environment, a stark contrast to the dirty factories that he had worked\n              in as a bookbinder, but disliked the inconsistent employment. Pane emphasizes the\n              politics of New York City, specifically the relationship between Democratic and\n              Republican policies during the Great Depression. He ascribes the depressions of the\n              early 20th century to the Republican administrations."

Preuhs begins by describing his\n              father's work in a bakery in Hamburg, Germany, noting his membership in a local union\n              and his progression from employee to manager of his own business. He describes working\n              as an apprentice for three years before traveling to various German cities during his\n              time as a journeyman. Preuhs explains that he joined the German merchant marine in\n              order to travel and was subsequently drafted into the German Navy in 1906, serving on\n              a warship stationed in Hamburg. Upon his discharge from the Navy, he acquired a\n              position on a merchant ship and illegally jumped ship in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1911.\n              He describes settling in the Beggars' Boarding House on 5th Street between 1st and 2nd\n              Avenue in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, noting the ease with\n              which he found work due to the myriad of small German bakeries in the city. He\n              explains that he worked in many of these bakeries in different parts of the city and\n              moved often in order to live near or in his current workplace. Other topics from his\n              life in the US include the seasonal nature of the baking industry; his time working in\n              Chicago, Illinois; and the development of technology in the baking industry and its\n              role in the obsolescence of many physical laborers."

This interview covers Reid's childhood in\n              Jamaica; his immigration to the United States (US); and work as a carpenter in\n              Charleston, South Carolina and New York, New York. Reid begins by describing his\n              childhood in Jamaica, noting that his grandfather owned a blacksmithery and a farm\n              that was relatively self-sufficient, growing produce and raising livestock for the\n              family. Reid describes his time at Mt. Zion School, noting his position as a teacher's\n              aide once he reached the upper levels of elementary school and the fact that his\n              mother wanted him to become a teacher, an occupation he had little interest in\n              pursuing. He discusses the history and genealogy of parts of his family and race\n              relations in Jamaica. He explains that when he was 16 years old, he became an\n              apprentice to carpenters employed by his cousin, noting that he learned general\n              carpentry and built houses and factories in Jamaica. Reid explains that he immigrated\n              to the US in 1919 and acclimated to the United States in Charleston, South Carolina\n              with a different cousin because of the warm weather there. He describes encountering\n              segregation in the southern United States, noting that he ignored these restrictions\n              with few repercussions. He describes working for the Standard Oil Company and recalls\n              the racial segregation of the workforce. He recounts joining Local 52 of an\n              unspecified carpenters' union in Charleston; its two locals organized by race; and the\n              specific territories marked for where each local's members were allowed to work. Reid\n              provides an extended description of his job with the Consolidated Gas Company in\n              Charleston, noting the details of his work and his relationship with the foreman. He\n              discusses his work at an unspecified company in New York owned by Philip Egensky.\n              Other topics include his involvement with a church in Jamaica; his leisure activities;\n              a comparison between race relations in the northern and southern United States; and\n              his participation in cricket leagues in both Jamaica and the US."

This interview covers Uttaro's\n              childhood in Italy; his immigration to the United States (US); and his life in Boston,\n              Massachusetts, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and New York, New York up to the time of the\n              interview. Uttaro describes his childhood and young adult life as being influenced by\n              liberal politics, recounting listening to Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta speak in\n              his hometown and how he developed a strong dislike for rules and organization. He\n              describes immigrating to the US as a way to become independent of his family,\n              particularly of his father's strict household rules. He recalls his first moments in\n              the US as frightening, describing how a stranger had to help him locate his cousin in\n              Somerville, Massachusetts after he got off the train in Boston. He recounts his life\n              in Pittsburgh with his sister; his return to Boston; and his dual responsibilities as\n              a presser working in a tailor shop during the day and as a student at night. He\n              describes his work as a presser as being seasonal and having to find various other\n              jobs during the off-season. He recounts marrying his wife in 1924; moving to New York\n              by himself in 1927 to pursue better employment opportunities; and sending for his\n              family a few months later. He notes that he had no desire to become an American\n              citizen until his son became upset about admitting at school that his father was not a\n              citizen, and that doing so ostracized him from some of his Socialist friends. He\n              describes becoming a member of both the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union\n              (ILGWU) Local 89 and the Industrial Workers of the World, detailing the growth of the\n              ILGWU despite tension between the Socialists and Communists within the union.\n              Throughout his interview, Uttaro emphasizes the practicality of compromise, noting\n              that even though he was an active member of the union and a Socialist, he tended to\n              criticize his affiliates when he believed they were pursuing their ideals to extremes.\n              He discusses taking part in a program through the union in which he visited older\n              union members who lived alone after he retired at age 65."
