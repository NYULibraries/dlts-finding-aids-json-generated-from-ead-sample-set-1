In addition to full-length features and video footage, the collection contains a small amount of ephemera, correspondence, home movies, and documentation related to the promotion and licensing of Bravo's films. Footage in this collection consists of interviews with political leaders and celebrities; scenes of historical events, marches, demonstrations, and performances; battle footage; clips from Cuba's State Council archives; speeches by Fidel Castro, Nelson Mandela, and others; and background footage (b-roll) used in finished films. This footage is primarily recorded on U-matic and Betacam video tapes, and produced on film reels, VHS, and DVD for screening and distribution.

She discusses her family in the United States and the difficulties of traveling between the two countries. She also talks about what she sees as the positive and negative changes in Cuba since the revolution. At the end of the video she shares her personal philosophy in both English and Spanish, and explains that her biggest desire in life is to do God's will and help others embrace his message."

They married in New York but he left for Cuba to join Castro's forces shortly after their wedding. She joined him in 1955 and lived in Cuba for the rest of her life. Burdsall taught at the National Dance School and was a founding member of Conjunto Nacional de Danza Moderna, which she eventually directed. Burdsall was with the company for nearly 20 years and created numerous works reflecting the spirit of the Cuban people. In 1977 she became the national director of dance and modern dance advisor to the Minister of Culture."

She discusses the United States relationship with Cuba and Latin America in general, and expresses a hope that the United States will act as a more collaborative neighbor, and do more to consider the struggles of people in the third world. The video ends with footage of signs and the countryside outside of Matanzas, Cuba."

He explains that his mother, singer Barbara Dane, performed in Cuba and later arranged for him to attend a music school there in 1966. He explains that youth in California in the 1960s were detached and had a very pessimistic view of the future. He explains that  life in Cuba at that time felt very different and students were engaged in political climate of the early revolutionary government. He describes meeting his wife at the school he attended, and explains that they married after he had only lived in Cuba for a year. He was only 15 years old at the time."

She discusses the reason she chose to live in Cuba over a life in the United States, and explains that as an actress she would rather perform in her country. Their son also joins the conversation and discusses his education at a music school where he is studying classical guitar. Menendez then discusses freedom of expression in Cuban music, and certain restrictions that the state places on music that it distributes. He ends with a brief discussion about his hopes for the world in the post-colonial era of the late-20th century."

She explains that her family is not sympathetic to the revolution, and expresses disappointment that US and Cuba have not maintained better relations.

They also briefly discuss raising children in Cuba and the community of Americans who came to live in Cuba following the revolution.

The interview begins with Paskalitis introducing her family and explaining how they came to live in Cuba. She explains that her husband Paul, who was a Greek maritime worker, was deported from the United State during the McCarthy era. Paskalitis explains that Paul's union activism made him a political target during the McCarthy era, and her children describe the impact of his deportation on their family. Paskalitis describes how the family moved to Cuba in 1960 when Paul took a job working for the Cuban fishing industry. The family talks generally about adjusting to life in Cuba, their work, and their identities as Greek, American, and Cuban."

Proctor begins by discussing how she first moved to Cuba in 1971 after traveling to the country with the progressive student group the Venceremos Brigade. She explains that she felt at home in Cuba and decided to stay after being expelled from her American high school because of her political activism. Proctor and her mother talk about racism in the United States, and Proctor explains that as a biracial woman she has felt more in welcome Cuba. She also discusses US policy toward Cuba, her hopes that the US embargo against Cuba will end, and her sense of shame about America's treatment of Cuba. At the end of the interview she expresses her hope that all of her cousins and nephews could come to Cuba to meet her Cuban family. Video quality of this recording is poor in places."

Some of the Americans featured in the documentary lived in Cuba prior and decided to remain after the new government was established, while others decided to immigrate to Cuba in the period following the revolution. This series contains footage from the 43-minute film, including interviews with women such as Elfriede Mahler; Marjorie Moore; Lorna Burdsall; Lois Kroehler, a missionary, music teacher and peace advocate who came to Cuba in 1949; Jean McEvoy and Ellen Rosensweig, who is interviewed with her husband and children and comments on the differences between her life in Cuba and her visits to see her family in California. Footage from this film contains one-on-one interviews, performances, discussions in the street or in other venues, and scenes of the various locations where the women live."

García calls for unity among Latin American nations to fight against the crisis of foreign debt facing their countries. He criticizes wealthy nations in the north, international banks, creditors, and global financial organizations for taking advantage of Latin America. He argues that economic imperialism has led to Peru's fiscal crisis and has created extreme suffering and poverty in Peru. He contends that the only way to push back against the insurmountable debt payments is through unity among Latin American nations."

Then at minute 8:45 it changes to footage of on-the-street interviews in Argentina. Estela Bravo asks several individuals about the country's political situation and foreign debt. Several of the interviewees express frustration with the country's politics, arguing that there is high unemployment and little opportunity for the average citizen to create political change. Several individuals discuss the country's foreign debt. They question the government's ability to pay its debt and argue that average communities suffer in poverty in the meantime."

Many express their concern that the poor will suffer, and others discuss the possibility of Latin American countries collectively deciding not to pay the debt. One member of the crowd suggests that without unity among Latin American nations the decision to not pay would result in economic chaos. Several men in the crowd note that they have been out of work for many years, and others speculate about what will happen in Argentina's future."

He describes the conditions that led to the debt crisis in Peru and expresses his skepticism about the country's ability to pay the debt."

In the interview, which was recorded in the mid-1980s, Ugarteche explains that the crisis had been building for over 10 years, and while the government focused on paying its international debt, it was not investing in the economy. He discusses the crisis of poverty, childhood hunger, and unemployment, and discusses economic changes that he thinks the country should take to emerge from the crisis. At minute 9:55 the video changes to a rally for Peruvian politician Alan García. Rally footage is incomplete and only contains short segments of his speech. The end of the video features footage of a concert."

It begins with two teachers at a kindergarten discussing the services they provide for poor children in the community. They describe the schools as a consistent source of food for local children. They also discuss high unemployment in the country and child malnutrition. The footage shows the children in the school singing songs and participating in a lesson on the alphabet. The video then changes to street footage of a slum outside of Bogotá where one of the teachers discusses the effects of foreign debt on the economy, the growth of slums, her Christian belief in Liberation Theology, and efforts to improve conditions in poor communities in the city. The video then cuts to footage of a different part of the city showing children selling goods on the street."

He explains that many parents are unemployed and cannot provide food for their children. The priest also shows Estela Bravo a baby at the community center, and explains that it is the child of a 13-year-old girl. He explains that young girls seek work as domestic servants, but those jobs were increasingly difficult to obtain and some turned to prostitution. The end of the video features an interview with two doctors at the center. They explain that they treated problems of malnutrition and parasitic infections, which were caused by unsanitary living conditions and lack of clean drinking water."

The first, Pablo, speaks with McIntyre about how US prisons profited off of the government funds they received for holding Cuban excludable aliens. Later they discuss his family, and Pablo cries as he explains that he does not know if he will be able to see them again. The next interview features Orlando Sierra who describes the events that led to his detention by US immigration and the confusing legal process he went through before he was deported. He describes being arrested for several non-violent crimes in the 1980s, being detained by immigration in 1991, and not understanding why he was deported or flagged by immigration at that time."

Leshaw begins by discussing how he came to represent Cuban detainees known as \"excludables\" through the organization Atlanta Legal Aid. He talks at length about the policy of US Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) that led to the detention of these people, and his firm's attempts to obtain trails for the detainees. He later discusses attempts to end the detention of Cuban excludable aliens through legislation, but suggests that they did not have significant support from the Cuban community in the US to pass legislation in their favor. He ends the tape with a short discussion about Judge Marvin Shoob's attempts to secure due process for the detainees."

In the interview Martineau discusses how he started working at the Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta where he treated Cuban detainees. He discusses the people he treated and describes many of them as suffering from a wide range of mental illnesses. He describes the psychiatric ward he presided over at the prison, the reason for its creation, and the ways in which his staff diagnosed, and treated Cuban detainees. McIntyre specifically asks Martineau to speak about the use of the sedative Thorazine to subdue patients, and address complaints from former prisoners about abuses in the psychiatric ward."

They begin by discussing the legal situation of the Mariel Cubans detained in the US Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta. They discuss touring the prison and the treatment of detainees that they witnessed. They also discuss meeting Dr. Bolivar Martineau and his work in the psychiatric ward of the prison. Finally, they discuss their legal work and constitutionality of the detention of the Cuban refugees. At minute 11:30 the video changes to an interview with Atlanta Legal Aid attorney Gary Leshaw. He describes his organization's attempts to secure trials for Cuban detainees and talks at length about the Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) policy that led to the detention of the Cubans."

He shares a story about a man who he argued never should have been detained by INS, but was held in a US prison for several years because of what he describes as an arbitrary decision and a failure to individually address his case. Shoob also discusses his attempts to gain the release of several detainees and the resistance he encountered from the federal government and prison administrators."

Smith cites Cuban attempts to establish normalized immigration policies with the United States, hijackings of Cuban boats by individuals seeking to reach the US, and the occupation of the Peruvian embassy in Cuba in 1980. He talks at length about the legal status of the Mariel Cubans who were listed as excludable, and others who were paroled into the country upon arrival. He also discusses the unique situation of Mariel, and the human rights abuses that many Mariel Cubans faced after they were detained by US immigration."

Smith discusses diplomatic talks between Cuba and the United States that took place under the administration of Jimmy Carter, but were stalled after Ronald Reagan took office. He talks about this history of US immigration policy toward Cuba and expresses his hope that the incoming Clinton administration will normalize relations. The last 10 minutes of the video focus on interviewer Linden McIntyre and feature him restating questions to make them more succinct for the edited film."

At the beginning, Aaron briefly introduces himself and discusses his baseball career. The bulk of the interview focuses on Aaron's impression of Cuba and Fidel Castro. Aaron describes traveling to Cuba to film a documentary about Cuban baseball players, and describes the quality of education and baseball training he observed while in Cuba. He also discusses meeting Fidel Castro, and speaks specifically about Castro's athletic ability. Aaron also talks briefly about the poor diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States, and argues that lack of trade and freedom of movement between the countries has contributed to the suffering of Cuban people and their family members in the United States."

He criticizes the United States electoral system, which he contrasts with Cuban local elections. In the second half of the interview he talks about Cuba's role in Latin America, discussing both support for the Cuban government and opposition from what he describes as counter-revolutionary movements. He also talks about the significance of Fidel Castro's beard and his predictions for Cuba's future after Castro's presidency."

The bulk of the interview focuses on Belafonte's travels to Cuba with his family. He discusses his musical performances, and his children's enjoyment of Cuban culture. Robinson discusses bringing her parents to Cuba, and their request to be buried there after they died."

Bourne begins with a lengthy discussion about the custody struggle over Elián González and the United States decision to return him to Cuba. He talks about the ways in which the struggle shifted Americans' perceptions of both Cuba and the exile community in Miami. The conversation then shifts to a general discussion about the way American opinions about Cuba are shaped by the press, which Bourne contrasts with that of other Latin American countries. The second part of the interview focuses on human rights in Cuba, healthcare, and education. He also briefly discusses why some Cubans have left the country, the Cuban economy, and the waning support Cuba received from the Soviet Union beginning in the 1980s."

Bourne speaks about Castro's leadership in Cuba addressing concerns about human rights, and Castro's role as a leader in the post-colonial era. He ends with a brief discussion about the history of American influence in Cuba and his expectations for Cuba's fate after the United States lifts the trade embargo and after Castro leaves office."

He discusses the ways in which Castro's upbringing influenced his political ideology, specifically citing his mother's Christianity. Later in the interview Bourne describes the influential women in Castro's life including Mirta Díaz-Balart, to whom he was married for 2 years, and his long-time partner Celia Sanchez. Bourne also talks at length about Castro's character and the impression he makes on the people who meet him. This interview was recorded in London and was not conducted by Estela Bravo, but rather an unidentified man who speaks off camera."

He also discusses Cuba's support of revolutions in Latin America, Castro's relationship with Maurice Bishop, the custody battle over Elián González, Cuban healthcare, Castro's views on globalization, and restrictions on freedom of speech. At minute 25:00 the video changes to footage of an auction featuring cigar boxes signed by Castro and dated March 3, 2000. At minute 27:35 footage changes to an event calling for the return of Elián González. The event features González's father Juan González Quintana, his grandmothers, and groups of school children performing Cuban songs and dances."

He discusses speaking with Díaz-Balart following the attack, and his legal representation of Raúl Castro prior to Fidel's capture. He also discusses the role of Marta Rojas who reported on the trials of the rebels captured at Moncada. At minute 22:44 Castellanos looks through photographs he saved from that period, and an image of Raúl Castro can be seen at the top of the stack. The video quality at the end of the recording is poor."

Castro contends that she does not believe Revuelta is her brother's daughter, but notes that he has never denied paternity.

Later in the interview Castro speaks about the impact the Cuban Revolution had on her life and her experience of having Fidel Castro as both a brother and a president. She also addresses criticism that her children received preferential treatment because Castro was their uncle."

Frady argues that many of the negative reactions against Castro were formed during the Cold War, and that much of the antipathy directed at Castro formed as a result of decades of poor diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States. The bulk of the interview focuses on popular perceptions of Fidel Castro, in which Frady describes him as a figure that inspired passionate reactions, both positive and negative. The interview is in English."

He also talks about his family members still living in Cuba, and the state of the country. He discusses Cuban exiles who have attempted to reach the US by raft or in the Mariel Boatlift, and blames Castro for the tragedies that had have happened as a result of people fleeing the country. Finally, Fusté discusses other anti-Castro Cubans in the United States including Orlando Bosch and Jorge Mas Canosa."

She then discusses Castro asking her to write a prolog for a book about her father, Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, and his role supporting the unsuccessful revolution in Congo.

She also describes Castro's relationship with Guevara, and how Castro convinced him to return to Cuba briefly before he left to support guerilla forces in Bolivia. In the last half of the interview, she reads from the letter Castro wrote to her father convincing him to return to Cuba."

Leal discusses the relationship between Fidel Castro and his brother Raúl, which he describes as one of extreme confidence and closeness.

Finally, he discusses Castro as a polarizing figure and talks about the opposition of many Cubans to his leadership.

Lesnik begins by discussing student activism at the University of Havana and clashes with Fulgencio Batista's government. He later discusses Fidel Castro's relationship with his first wife Mirta Díaz-Balart. He later describes Fidel's interest weapons and military action, and describes how the beginnings of Castro's coalition grew out of a militant faction he developed within the Partido Ortodoxo (Orthodox Party). Lesnik details Castro's personality as a young man and suggests that peers viewed him as audacious and likely to achieve prominence. He later addresses a question about racism and notes that as a Jewish man he did face some racism in Cuba, but argues that the generation that he and Castro were a part of held much less prejudice."

He later discusses an attempt to interview Fidel Castro at a boxing match in Monaco. He describes interviewing Castro 13 years after his initial attempt, and credits Márquez with facilitating the interview. He describes his interview with Castro in which they discussed Cuban human rights, scientific research, and the death of Che Guevara. The video contains frequent background noise, which makes some of the interview difficult to hear in places."

He also briefly discusses Celia Sanchez and her support of public health. He discusses his perceptions of Fidel Castro as a man, and describes his relationship with Castro at el Colegio de Belén. He discusses his decision to stay in Cuba after the revolution despite the fact that many of his family members fled the country. Video quality is poor in several places."

He argues that what Cuba needs most is not internal political reform, but rather a change in the United States foreign policy toward Cuba. He argues that the United States needs to respect Cuban sovereignty by lifting the blockade and improving diplomatic relations with the Cuban government. Ortega states that he does not think Castro believes in Communism, but rather adopted the political structure in opposition to the United States. He suggests that by aligning with the Soviet Union Castro hoped avoid a US funded coup similar to the overthrow of Jacobo Árbenz in Guatemala. At the end of the interview he discusses his writing career and how his opinions toward Cuba have changed over the years."

He also talks about the custody battle over Elián González and the image of Fidel Castro as a figure of anti-imperialism in Latin American. At minute 16:31 the footage changes to an interview with Max Lesnik. Lesnik describes his acquaintance with Castro at the University of Havana, where they were classmates. Lesnik discusses Castro's politics during that era, and the inspiration Castro drew from the political leader Eduardo Chibás and the writings of José Martí.

Sheinbaum talks about meeting Fidel Castro and his impression of Castro as a political leader, which he contrasts with his experience meeting Syrian leader Bashar al Assad.

He addresses the criticism and admiration of Castro, and compares Castro's government with Cuba under the presidency of Fulgencio Batista. He also discusses a potential meeting between Castro and President Bill Clinton, but suggests that such a meeting would be contingent on the political situation in the United States. The end of the interview features still images of Sheinbaum with both Castro and Clinton."

He addresses criticism of Castro as a dictator, and contends that he does not consider dictators frightening. He also discusses returning to Cuba in 1993. He describes meeting Castro again, and describes their meeting as amiable. In the second half of the interview Estela Bravo shares a yearbook from Colegio de Belén during the years when he was a teacher of Fidel Castro. Varela looks through the yearbook and shares stories about students and his memories at the school."

The majority of the clips feature rallies and town meetings in Cuba calling for the return of Elian González. Castro does not speak in any of the clips, but can be seen greeting crowds. In one section he speaks to González's father Juan Miguel González Quintana, but cannot be heard due to poor audio quality. Other clips feature Castro touring a Cuban medical school with American reporter Andrea Mitchell, and clips included at the end of the tape feature Castro greeting crowds during his travels to other countries."

Castro begins speaking around minute 5:00. He begins by offering his support and hope for the creation of a new South Africa led by Nelson Mandela, and commends Mandela for his commitment to justice following the end of the apartheid system. Castro calls for an end to divisions on the basis of race, and encourages South Africa and its political leaders to seek to address problems in economic inequality. He discusses the history of colonialism, which led to slavery and exploitation across the globe, expresses his hope that the new South African government will serve as an example of how to break free from the legacy of that system. Audio quality of this video is poor in places."

Castro begins by thanking the leaders of the South African government, and calls for reforms with the United Nations to provide greater representation of countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

He likewise criticizes the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, both of which he argues disproportionately benefit wealthy nations, and the United States in particular. In his speech Castro also criticizes wealthy nations development and sales of weapons, lack of respect for the environment, and displacement of people in the third world."

The bulk of the video features footage of the crowd waiting for Castro's arrival. At minute 1:55 Estela Bravo briefly interviews Bronx Congressman Jose Serrano about his opinions of Castro and the reason the crowd at the church is eager to hear him speak. At minute 10:16 the footage changes to an interview with an American diplomat who was part of the negotiations to return Elian González to Cuba. She talks about Castro as a negotiator and her perceptions of working with him on the González case. The footage also shows Fidel Castro arriving at the church and brief welcoming statements from various speakers."

The beginning of the video begins with representatives entering the chamber and welcoming Castro. Portions of this speech are duplicated on the video ref150. Duplicated content runs approximately from minute 12:00 to 41:00. After minute 41:00 Castro continues speaking about the potential of African youth and stresses Cuba's history of solidarity with African nations and the third world. He addresses challenges facing Africa like deforestation, desertification, and HIV/AIDS. The end of the video focuses on speculative investment and the United States economy, in which Castro criticizes the US for artificially inflating its currency. Video and audio quality of this recording is very poor."

The footage begins part-way through Castro's speech.

He also talks about Cuba's support of independence struggles in Angola and South Africa, and the United Nations lack of recognition for their support. After Castro's speech concludes, footage shows him leaving the church and greeting members of the crowd."

It begins by describing the political and economic climate of Cuba prior to the revolution. The program then details events of the revolution, including the siege on the Moncada barracks, Castro's invasion from Mexico, and the revolutionaries in the Sierra Maestra. It then discusses Cuban life and government after the revolution, and describes events leading up to the Bay of Pigs invasion. The program is narrated in English, but is told from a Cuban perspective. The video does not contain a complete version of the program and starts and stops in various places."

He talks in particular about Catholicism and his perception of religion as a vehicle to acquire power. Castro also discusses his memories of the events of the Cuban Revolution."

The first clip includes on-the-street footage of overcrowded buses in Havana, and people waiting in long bus lines. The clips show footage of people on bicycles, and a few cars driving by on the streets. At minute 6:10 the video switches to footage of Fidel Castro on a visit to Vietnam. This footage does not have any sound, but shows Castro meeting state leaders and shaking hands with groups of people. At minute 7:41 the tape switches to older black and white footage of a hurricane and rescue efforts to help Cuban communities affected by flooding and storm damage."

The first clip briefly shows footage of Elián González receiving a book signed by Fidel Castro, the second features Castro walking in a parade, and the next features part of a speech by US Representative Maxine Waters welcoming Castro to New York City. At minute 7:28 the video switches to footage of an interview with Arthur Strimling. In the interview, Strimling talks about watching Castro speak in Harlem in 1959. He describes the crowds who gathered to see Castro and the reception Castro received from the media and political leaders. Strimling also talks about how his views on Castro changed over the years. He explains that although he has admiration for the economic revolution in Cuba, he is troubled by the country's human rights abuses and repression of political opposition."

The majority express their belief that Cuban government will remain intact. Individuals on the street also discuss their opinions about the Cuba socialism, and the reasons they have stayed in the country when many others have left."

The mother and daughter discuss their reasons for supporting the flotilla and express their frustration at the people opposing it. They criticize the United States embargo against Cuba, and contend the that flotilla is a matter of human rights not politics. The video then shows footage of people loading a boat with supplies. At minute 14:10, Bravo interviews a group of people opposing the flotilla who argue that the goods will be taken by the Cuban government and sold to tourists. They express their doubt that the Cuban people will receive the goods, and instead express their fear that Castro will use the aid to control the people."

The end of video features a second interview with the spokesman from Basta at a children's hospital where many of the supplies were delivered. He explains that the purpose of the event at the hospital is to prove that the supplies are being delivered directly to the people."

Also documented are the activities of many of the anti-Castro groups in Florida and in New Jersey who violently opposed travel between the United States and Cuba. Appearing in the film are US politicians including Republican Senator and former Representative from Arizona Jeff Flake; Republican former Senator and Representative from Idaho, Larry Craig; Democratic former Representative from Massachusetts, Bill Delahunt; and Democratic Massachusetts Representative, Jim McGovern. In the documentary they contend that travel between the countries builds openness and understanding; strengthens family ties; fosters cultural exchange, tourism and trade; and is a constitutional right for all Americans. No raw footage associated with the film is available. Only a completed version of the documentary is included in this series."

They were attacked and beaten by a patrol of military police, soaked with gasoline, and set on fire. De Negri died of his burns. Gloria suffered second and third degree burns over 62% of her body; she was critically ill and was moved to a hospital in Canada. Although she survived, Gloria was badly disfigured from her burns. When the Pope visited Chile in 1987, she returned and was able to meet with the pontiff in Santiago."

She says that she hopes to continue fighting and speaking out against the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, but acknowledges that protest is still very difficult. She also discusses a button featuring the Rodrigo Andres Rojas de Negri, who died when they were both attacked by members of the Chilean military and burned. She explains that she hopes to be a representative of Rojas's memory. At minute 10:56 the footage changes to Chilean youths discussing a mural of Quintana and Rojas, painted at the location where they were attacked. A young woman and young man speak with Bravo about the significance of Quintana and Rojas to the youth movement in Chile."

The footage shows protestors building makeshift barriers and throwing objects while police try to disperse them.

The video features several on-the-street interviews: one with a man opposed to the protests, one with a local journalist, and one with a young protester. The end of this video also features an interview with exiled Chilean Socialist leader Clodomiro Almeyda. In the interview Almeyda discusses why he chose to return to Chile during the Pope's visit to the country."

They argue that the people protesting his government are mistaken and supporters of terrorism. Several students express their admiration for Pinochet, and contend that he saved the country from communism. Other students express their dislike of Pinochet, and contend that the students who support him are uninformed and are not in a position to understand the political situation of the country."

The family in the house explains that they police chased the boy, broke down their door, and hit the young boy in the head causing him to bleed significantly. Several of the children and adults in the house describe witnessing the event. They also talk about police treatment of the poor and substandard living conditions in their community."

He discusses leaving Chile when he was 3 years old, and returning to Chile later in life. He also talks about his involvement in leftist political movements in Chile and his participations in Chile's Socialist Youth. He discusses the significance of the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1987, and the 1989 general elections. Letelier talks at length about the political climate in Chile at the end of the 1980s discussing the country's transition to democracy and the influence of youth activism.

They discuss their involvement in the resistance movement against the Pinochet government and the violence they have witnessed in the country. The interview focuses on the government's use of torture against citizens. The woman shares specific examples of torture used against Chilean citizens, discuss police interrogation methods, and describes the psychological effects of state-sponsored violence. At minute 12:00 the video features a demonstration against the government, and protestors can be seen clashing briefly with the police. Bravo interviews members of the crowd about why they are at the protest, and about their expectations for the upcoming 1987 visit of Pope John Paul II."

The end of the video changes back to footage of Quintana, and features portion of a speech she delivered to a village in Chile."

It traces the story of Carmen Gloria Quintana and her 1987 journey back to Chile to see the Pope. In addition to footage of the Pope's visit and the ongoing protests the documentary includes interviews with Quintana and many others. Among the voices captured are those of elites, particularly young people, who supported the Pinochet government and felt the protests were unnecessary. Footage in this series includes shots of Quintana touring Chile, speeches by the Pope, interviews with Quintana and other Chileans, and historical footage contextualizing Chilean politics."

He then talks about his 10-year imprisonment in Uruguay by the country's military dictatorship. He describes Uruguay's transition to democracy and the influence of the country's foreign debt on that process. He explains that he is optimistic about the transition to democracy, but contends that the process has just begun and that the country has a long history of repression and disappearance of political dissidents that needs to be addressed. At the end of the interview he expresses his gratitude to Castro and Cuba for supporting the Communist Party in Uruguay and its fight against the military dictatorship."

Beginning at minute 4:00 the footage switches to an interview with three young Namibians.

The three students, all of whom received part of their education in Cuba, talk about their experiences studying in Cuba and the ways they hope to use their educations. They also talk briefly about continued racism in Namibia between white and black communities, and feeling removed from their country after studying abroad for several years."

In the wake of the rumors, Cuban parents sent as many as 14,000 unaccompanied children on flights out of Cuba between 1960 and 1962. The United States government facilitated this mass exodus of Cuban children, which became popularly known as Operation Peter Pan, through a clandestine program that waived the children's visa requirements and provided several million dollars to the Miami Catholic Welfare Bureau to care for the children. Many parents expected to be reunited with their children after what they believed would be the swift fall communist government. Following the Bay of Pigs invasions in 1962, however, US-Cuba relations deteriorated, and permanently separated many parents and children. Some children were able to connect with family members in the United States, but approximately 7000 were moved into long-term orphanages or foster care."

Walsh begins by discussing the children currently in the care of his Catholic organization in Miami. At the time of the interview Walsh explained that he was caring for 25 children between the ages of 14 and 18. He describes the motivation of many Cuban parents who decided to send their children to the United States in the early 1960s, explaining that many feared their children would be sent to Russia for communist indoctrination. He also discusses his organization's role in clandestine efforts to send Cuban children the US, and explains that parents expected Castro would be overthrown and their children would quickly return. He later discusses children who had a difficult time adjusting to life in the US, and the Miami-based youth organization the Antonio Maceo Brigade, which was outspoken in its support of the Cuban government."

He contends that his government is protecting democracy, and argues that if critics understood the threat that Chile faced they would know that his actions were correct.

Godoy's mother begins by discussing the youth movement in Chile and the reasons Chilean youth have expressed such strong resistance to the Pinochet government. At the time of the interview, which was filmed sometime around 1985, she explains that the children have lived under Pinochet for 12 years and many remember their family members disappearing or going into exile, and cannot see a future for themselves under the current government. She expresses her hope in the community and her faith that the government will eventually change. The video then focuses on news reports and photos of Carols Godoy and his murder. At minute 17:55 the videos changes to an interview with the executive secretary of the foundation Protection of Youth Damaged by State of Emergency (PIDEE), which helped children whose parents had been harmed, detained, or disappeared by the government. She describes the foundation, its goals, and the kind of support it provides to the children whose families were targeted for political reasons."

She then discusses how her family moved to Cuba in 1973 following the coup of Augusto Pinochet, and their decision to return to Chile. She describes learning about her brother's death and how the news affected her. She also discusses her hopes of becoming a lawyer or journalist in the future, and her desire to find work that will serve the community."

At the beginning of the video police can be see chasing demonstrators outside of the cemetery. The video then features an interview with the mother of Carlos Godoy at his grave. Godoy's mother talks about her son, and his murder, and describes him as emblematic of many Chilean youth. After the interview with Godoy's mother, a man speaks about the memory of Godoy and the importance of continued resistance against Augusto Pinochet in Chile."

This documentary explores the experience of youth who returned to Chile without their parents after living in exile for many years.  Several of the youths featured in the documentary discuss their difficulty adjusting to life in Chile and struggles with identity. A portion of the film focuses on Carlos Godoy Echegoyen, a twenty-three-year-old Socialist who died under torture in a police station in the port of Quintero in February 1985, shortly after returning from exile. Bravo interviews his mother and his sister. It also features scenes in a cemetery at Godoy's grave and the graves of others, including Victor Jara, and Salvador Allende. The film also tells the story of three children from one family whose parents were taken and who must fend for themselves."

Silvio Rodriguez and Pablo Milanes, two of Cuba's most popular composer-singer-musicians, organized the concert, which featured some of the best Argentine folk musicians at that time. The documentary shows the enthusiastic response of the Argentine people, as the musicians perform songs that had previously been prohibited in Argentina. This series contains footage of Rodriguez and Milanes in Argentina, as well as some footage of the performers at a concert in the Bronx."

The footage features a series of on-the-street interviews conducted by Estela Bravo in Union City, New Jersey in which she asks the men why they traveled to the United States and what they hoped to find. The majority of the men interviewed were living in the United States for less than a year at the time the interviews were conducted. Many mention that they left Cuba because they did not agree with the communist government. Others explain that they left to find better work and earn money although several mention that they have had a difficult time finding work in the United States. They likewise describe finding it difficult to get adequate housing and access to medical care. One man notes that he has received little support from the existing Cuban community in the US, and has received more support from other immigrant groups including Puerto Ricans and Dominicans. Some of the men mention travelling to the US as part of the Mariel Boatlift. The term \"escoria\" refers to a statement made by Fidel Castro about Cuban exiles, comparing those who left to escoria (scum)."

In the documentary, Estela Bravo sheds light on major events in the history of US-Cuba relations including Operation Peter Pan and the Mariel Boatlift. The documentary also features interviews with Cuban Americans in favor of normalizing relations between the United States and Cuba, and others who support the overthrow of the communist government in Cuba. This series contains interviews with individuals featured in the documentary, footage of immigration workers, and incomplete portions of the documentary, and an early version of the film, which was originally called \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eEl Dialogo\u003c/span\u003e."

They did not tell anyone about their journey, and after a few months of living in the United States, they asked to Cuba's representatives in the United States for permission to return. They were finally able to return to Cuba, and upon their arrival, they share their experiences with relatives who knew nothing of their travels to the United States.

The first interview features the widow of Cuban pacifist Luciano Nieves. She discusses her husband's assassination, and describes him as a pioneer for calling for improved relations between the US and Cuba in the 1970s. The second interview features anti-Castro political activist Felipe Rivero. Rivero discusses his involvement in the Bay of Pigs invasion and addresses criticism about members of his movement who have been charged with or convicted of terrorism. He specifically discusses members of his organization who were convicted for the assassination of Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier. The third interview features Miami priest Father Bryan Walsh. Walsh discusses his role in sponsoring Cuban children traveling to the US without their parents between 1960 and 1962, and the US government's role in supporting that work. The final 30 minutes to the tape feature assorted clips recorded from television. Video and audio quality is very poor and the bulk of the content on the second half of this tape is difficult to view."

They explains that they were able to survive with financial support from the government, and assistance from their neighbor who tried to help them as much as she could. At the time the interview was recorded in 1991, the family had not been able to locate their mother, and they did not know if she was still living."

The footage was recorded in Springfield, MA on the 25th anniversary of the Rosenberg's death for a Cuban television program. Bravo asks the Meeropols about their travel to Cuba and their impressions of the country. Much of the video on this recording is in poor condition, and in many places only the audio is available. The children of Michael and Robert Meeropol discuss their visit to Cuba and describe their understanding of how their grandparents died. At the end of the segment the family sings the Cuban folk song \"Guantanamera.\" Beginning at minute 12:00 the video changes to various clips from Cuban television programs. Many of these clips contain no audio. The second half of the video features a boxing match."

Clippings include copies of articles about Estela Bravo's films, interviews, reviews, and biographical articles about her career as a filmmaker. A large portion of this series consists of programs for conferences and documentary film festivals. Bravo's films were shown at many of these festivals but not all. The series also contains several playbills from dance and theatrical performances attended by the Bravos. Playbills do not relate to filmmaking, but rather reflect the artistic interests of the Bravos. Additionally, the series contains copies of the documentaries \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003ePorque Moncada?\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eManos a la Obra\u003c/span\u003e. These documentaries were not created by Estela Bravo, but they address topics similar to those featured in her films."

Reels contain footage of events including parties, vacations, and visits with family. They feature the Bravos during the early years of their marriage and include footage of personal moments with their children and friends. The home movies were shot in a number of locations including New York, Miami, Paris, and São Paulo. A set of reels in this series were numbered 1-7; these numbers were created by Estela and Ernesto Bravo. Several reels were accompanied with limited contextual information and have yet to be identified. Family films that are in digital formats contain similar content as several of the reels, and many have been modified to contain sound. Several videos have been overlaid with music, while others contain audio of Estela Bravo explaining events captured in the films. Contents of these videos largely document the travels of the Bravos in the 1950s."

Hernández, along with four other Cuban agents, was arrested in Miami in 1998 for spying on the United States, they became known as the Cuban Five. The Cuban government claimed they were spying on anti-Cuban terrorists  in Miami, but the five were ultimately convicted of espionage and acting as foreign agents. In 2014 as US-Cuban relations began to thaw the United States government helped Hernández and Perez conceive a child through artificial insemination. Hernández and two other Cuban agents were released that year in exchange for several American prisoners in Cuba. Hernández returned to Cuba two months before the birth of his daughter, Gema."
