The majority of the narrators lived in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Other narrators include residents of the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan; members of the Three Arrows Cooperative Society in Putnam Valley, New York; veterans of the Vietnam War; and jazz musicians in New York City between 1940 and 1960.  The narrators reflect the changing ethnic composition of different neighborhoods in New York City, and include Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe; immigrants from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Central America; and migrants from the southern United States and Puerto Rico.  Topics covered by the interviews include life in tenements in the LES, life in public and cooperative housing in the LES, family life, ethnic identities, intercultural and interracial relations in New York City, education, religion, paid and unpaid work, immigration and migration experiences, religious and social activities in East Harlem, Asian American activism, socialist and anarchist organizations, political activism, anti-war movements, community gardens in New York City, and experiences of women in higher education through the 1970s and 1990s.  In addition to the interviews, the collection includes transcripts (full and partial) of interviews, notes on and indexes of interviews, field notes taken by interviewers, and preliminary questionnaires completed by narrators.  Some files include articles and ephemera created by the narrators or are related to the topics they discussed in the interviews.",

Most of the interviews were conducted by graduate students in Bernstein's classes with some interviews conducted in 1993 by volunteers from the Workmen's Circle, who were trained by Bernstein in two day-long seminars.  The interviews conducted by the Workmen's Circle volunteers were used in planning the design of the Tenement Museum at 97 Orchard Street in the LES."

Arinberg discusses the different apartments in which her family lived in the LES and the fact that the family would move to obtain lower rent.  She discusses her parents, their backgrounds, and their immigration to the United States.  She recounts her father's various occupations, including his trimming store on Christie Street in the LES and his business peddling textiles.  She discusses her mother's occupations as a finisher in the garment industry and as a peddler of house dresses and aprons.  She describes the apartments in which her family lived, particularly the cold and her loneliness after school when her parents were at work.  She discusses ethnic and racial relations in the LES from the early 20th century to the time of the interview.  She recounts going to Central Park in Manhattan, Prospect Park in Brooklyn, and the Yiddish theatre with her mother, and other leisure activities in which she participated.  Other topics include burglaries that took place in her family's apartments, her religious upbringing, and living conditions in the buildings in which her family lived in the LES."

The interview covers Beck's experiences as the Director of the Henry Street Settlement in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and as Executive Director at the Mobilization for Youth in the LES.  Beck discusses his education and his family, including his work in the Merchant Marine before entering college and his parents' involvement with the Henry Street Settlement.  He discusses his cooperative jobs while a student at Antioch College in Ohio and the fact that these led to his interest in social work.  He describes the youth development programs at the Settlement and recounts the creation and mission of Mobilization for Youth.  He discusses Helen Hall, her philosophy of social work, and her involvement in the creation of Mobilization for Youth.  He recounts a strike by Settlement staff in 1965 and the division this led to between the Settlement, Mobilization for Youth, and other organizations in the LES.   He describes the differing approaches to social work between the Settlement and Mobilization for Youth and the communities each served.  He recounts becoming the Director at the Settlement and issues he faced directing both the Settlement and Mobilization for Youth.  He compares his relationship with Helen Hall with her relationship with Lillian Wald.  Other topics include Beck's experiences on an unspecified New York City school board and ethnic and racial tensions in the LES.\nFor more interviews with employees of the Henry Street Settlement, see Gold, Leona; McGee-Robinson, Audrey Peters; O'Malley, Nora."

The interview covers Behrend's childhood, her training in violin at the Juilliard School in Manhattan, her career as a violin teacher at Juilliard and the Music School at the Henry Street Settlement in Manhattan, and her role as an early adopter of the Shinichi Suzuki method of violin instruction in the United States.  Behrend relates her early interest in music, her family's musical background, and her introduction to the violin at ten years old.  She recalls studying violin at the Universität Mozarteum Salzburg in Austria and at the Institute for Musical Art in New York.  She discusses auditioning at Juilliard in 1939 and her time there over the next three years, including the teachers, the other students, and the course of study.  Behrend discusses her decision to become a violin teacher; her years teaching at the Henry Street Settlement with Grace Spofford, Robert Egan, and Ivan Galamian; and her students at Henry Street.  She recalls her decision to leave Henry Street and her introduction to Shinichi Suzuki and his method of teaching violin.  She describes the Suzuki method and how she applied that method at Henry Street and the School for Strings. \nFor more interviews about the Music School at the Henry Street Settlement see Baron, Samuel; Canin, Martin; and Herman, David."

The majority of the interview covers Beatrice Berson's childhood experiences visiting her grandparents in Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Berson recalls the tenement building in which her grandparents lived as being dirty, especially the shared toilet in the hallway.  She remembers the population of her grandparents saving and collecting fruit wrappers to use as toilet paper.  Berson describes her grandparents' apartment as being a dimly lit railroad apartment with a kitchen, front room and two bedrooms with only cold water and steam heat.

She explains that two boarders lived with the family, making for a crowded living environment.  Binder describes assisting her mother with the family's laundry.  Binder recalls her family moving from Scammel Street to Madison Street in the LES and the apartments' similar railroad floorplans.  She recalls sitting on the fire escape while her mother gave birth inside their apartment for each of her three siblings, due to the small size of the apartment and lack of privacy.  Binder describes shopping with her mother at the pushcarts and local butcher for groceries each day."

He discusses the prominence of wholesale and retail businesses in the Lower East Side during the 1930s-1960s.  Breskin describes the interrogation he received when applying for his United States citizenship in the 1920s.  He concludes his interview stating that he does not see any future in wholesale and retail in the Lower East Side, but hopes that he is wrong."

Breslow discusses growing up on the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York; her relationship with her family; and her participation in Hashomer Hatzair. Breslow describes playing in tenement hallways and in the streets of the LES. She discusses the fact that her parents were older than the parents of other children her age and how she worried as a child that they would die. She describes her relationship with her older siblings who were born in Poland; she describes being inspired by her older sister who returned to college and learned to swim later in life. Breslow discusses the reasons she enjoyed belonging to the Hashomer Hatzair, including folk dancing and the perceived seriousness of the youth group. She describes her preference for Brooklyn over the LES because of its spaciousness and greenery."

The majority of the interview covers Luba Kadison Buloff's experiences as a Yiddish theatre actor and her acting experiences in Europe and the United States (US).  Buloff recalls growing up in the acting world and traveling throughout Europe to perform for various Jewish communities.  Buloff states that after immigrating to the US, she continued to act, that her entire life was related to theatre, and that she did not socialize outside of the troupe.  Buloff described 2nd Avenue in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York as lively due to the large volume of Yiddish theatres and high attendance of each show.  She explains that by the 1940s, she thought that the Yiddish theatre had become too commercialized, which led her to move to Chicago, Illinois.  Buloff explains that she felt that the New York Yiddish theatre became less about the art of acting and more about profits and fame."

The interview covers Canin's family and experiences at the Music School at the Henry Street Settlement in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  Canin recounts his introduction to the piano and the Music School at the Henry Street Settlement.  He discusses his teachers at the Henry Street Settlement, Aurelio Giorni and Robert Scholz, and elaborates on his relationship with Scholz.  He discusses his family, including the instruments each member played and his relationship with his brother, Stuart Canin.  He discusses Rosemary Younker; her patronage of the Music School; her sponsorship of him, which allowed for his attendance at the Meadowmount School of Music in Lewis, New York; and his relationship with her son, Herman.  Other topics include his experiences as a student at the Juilliard School in Manhattan and in the United States Army Band during the Korean War.  For more interviews about the Music School at the Henry Street Settlement see Baron, Samuel; Behrend, Louise; and Herman, David."

DeAngelo's husband, Sam DeAngelo, participates in the first half of the interview.  The interview covers Rose DeAngelo's family and working life.  DeAngelo discusses her childhood, including the apartments in which her family lived and the fact that her mother had 15 children.  She discusses the death of seven of her siblings as infants, causes of infant mortality in the early 20th century, and the death of her father.  She describes her siblings, their careers, and their families.  DeAngelo and her husband recount their wedding and their 50th and 60th anniversary celebrations.  Sam DeAngelo discusses discipline in school and at home, his working life, and his and Rose's reasons for staying in the LES.  Rose DeAngelo discusses different jobs she had in an unspecified hat factory,  at the American Steel Wool Manufacturing Company factory, as a tomato packer at an unspecified factory, and as a seamstress in an unspecified garment factory in the LES.  She explains that she and her friend were strike breakers in the hat factory and her opinions of labor unions before and after this experience.  She discusses the custom of having midwives attend at home births, her mother's four sets of twins, and their mortality rate.  DeAngelo describes her work as a seamstress at Post Manufacturing Company on Lafayette Street, including the types of athletic clothes she made, the decline of the business, and working conditions in the factory.  She describes the apartments in which she lived in the LES and sections of the neighborhood, including Worth Street and Mulberry Street Park.  Other topics include military service of DeAngelo's family members, crime in the LES in the 1910s and at the time of the interview, Italian residents of the LES, and benefits of her membership in an unspecified labor union (likely the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America)."

Dell explains the rules of box baseball, stickball, punchball, kick the can, and marbles.  He recalls having to pause in the middle of stickball games to allow cars to drive past the game.  Dell describes why Katz's Delicatessen is popular, stating his belief that maintaining their same means of operation, menu, location, and food preparation have all attributed to the delicatessen's continual success."

The interview is primarily with Nellie Dick and her son, Jim Dick, occasionally participates.  The majority of the interview covers Nellie Dick's recollections of anarchist communities in London, England; New York; and New Jersey.   Dick recalls attending a lecture given by Johann Rudolf Rocker in London when she was eight or nine years old and being the only child present at the lecture.  She explains that her immersion into politics at a young age resulted in her dedicated involvement in the anarchist community.  Dick goes into detail about what she considers to be the fundamental differences between anarchists and Communists, one being the belief that there should be a bit of a hierarchy to the working and social structure of a community.  She describes teaching herself to read Yiddish and her eagerness to learn.  Dick recalls working closely with her fellow principals at the Modern School to write the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eVoice of the Children\u003c/span\u003e, a Stelton Colony publication.  As leaders of the Ferrer Colony, Nellie and her husband each proposed and carried out projects to better the community, including better living conditions for the boarding school students and improvements to school buildings.  She explains that not only did the students attend classes at the school, they were also responsible for maintaining the grounds of the school.  Dick describes teaching her students manners as she strongly believed in etiquette and discipline.  Dick expresses her adoration for the Stelton Colony and her pride as a contributing leader of that community, as she was a proponent of always improving the community.  She also explains the colony's mission, which expresses the importance of responsibility in order to have freedom, and the living atmosphere of the Ferrer Colony.  Dick explains that she knew she belonged within the Ferrer Colony because she shared the outstanding belief that there should be a change in government and that all individuals should receive an education."

Rebecca Epstein discusses the fact that her teachers in New York loved her Boston accent while her classmates derided it. She describes the layout and furnishing of her family's railroad apartment in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York and discusses her family's practice of taking on boarders who were recent immigrants. She describes immigrants entering the United States through Castle Garden in Manhattan. Epstein discusses the deaths of three of her siblings, two of whom died from infantile cholera, or summer complaint. Epstein discusses her relationship with her father, in particular his attitude of superiority towards her mother and how his perceived hypocrisy led to Epstein's decision to become an atheist. Epstein also discusses childhood activities for earning money such as completing piecework and charging admission for plays organized by neighborhood children."

Ida Fier describes her childhood and adolescence in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. She describes witnessing her father's death of a heart attack and her embarrassment at her mother's subsequent decision to become the janitor at their 232 Rivington Street apartment. Fier discusses her relationship with her mother, in particular her support of Fier's desire to attend college and their conflict over Orthodox Judaism. She describes feeling unable to discuss abortion and menstruation with her mother. Fier describes the importance of local institutions such as the Henry Street Settlement and the local library for entertainment and education. She describes doing schoolwork at the public library when there were guests at home, going to school during the summer to learn basket and rug weaving, and taking piano lessons at the Henry Street Settlement. She discusses the limited enforcement of quarantines in the LES. Fier discusses joining the Communist Party of the United States of America in college and being a student teacher at Seward Park High School. Fier discusses the impact of nostalgia on accounts of the LES by her generation, arguing that people are sentimental about their youths because their lives had more potential."

The majority of the interview covers Deborah Borgenicht Flynn's memories of her family, in particular her father, Louis Borgenicht.

Flynn recalls accompanying her father to his garment factory, Borgenicht and Spiro, Inc., in Manhattan, New York.  She describes her father's work ethic, but cannot recall specific details regarding his business.  Flynn recalls visiting the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan at a young age with her mother and bringing food to poor Jewish families.  Flynn describes the tenement buildings in the LES as very crowded and dirty and compares this to her experiences in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan."

The majority of the interview covers Estelle Lieberman Friedman's experiences as a child in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  She describes the layout of the family's apartment on Ludlow Street in the LES, including the shared toilet in the hallway.  Friedman recalls the apartment being converted to electric power when she was three years old.  She discusses having an operation as a young child and states that it was performed by a neighborhood doctor on her kitchen table.  She recalls the doctor running electricity from the hallway in order to use the necessary medical tools for the surgery.  Friedman recalls playing on the fire escape during the summer and neighbors gathering to sit on the building stoops.  She describes the abundance of pushcarts in the LES that sold various food items and dry goods."

The interview covers Harris's early life in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and her family.  Harris discusses the death of her mother when she was six months old and her father's second marriage when Harris was four years old.  She describes her family's apartments on Broome and Monroe Streets in the LES, the neighborhoods around each apartment, and the family's living arrangements.  She discusses her dislike of the public baths, particularly having to bathe with strangers.  She discusses attending the Madison House summer camp when she was eight years old and remembers the differences between life in the LES and in the country.  She discusses attending events and participating in activities at settlement houses in the LES, in particular the Madison House and an unspecified settlement house on Hester Street.  She describes events and customs in the LES surrounding local and national elections.  She discusses becoming aware of politics, including joining the American Student Union at Seward Park High School in the LES and attending events in Union Square in Manhattan on May 1.  She discusses her family, including her relationship with her stepmother and the fact that her stepmother did not want anyone to know that she was not Harris's mother.  Other topics include vermin in the family's apartments, her relationship with her extended family, and ways in which the family members negotiated privacy for themselves in their apartments."

The interview covers Herman's experiences at the Music School at the Henry Street Settlement in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan.  Herman discusses his parents, their immigration experiences, and their careers.  He discusses his education at an unspecified yeshiva in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn and describes Williamsburg.  He recounts his first experiences in the LES and compares the LES and Williamsburg neighborhoods in the 1950s.  He discusses studying the violin at the Music School with Louise Behrend, recalls his memories of his first days at the school, and describes the building in which the school was housed on Pitt Street in the LES.  He describes Behrend and her philosophy of teaching violin.  He discusses other students at the school, the level at which they were expected to perform, and his participation in the School's orchestra.  He discusses his Jewish identity in terms of the time he spent in Williamsburg and in the LES, and the conflict he perceived in expectations of him in the two neighborhoods.  He discusses his friends at the School and performances of the orchestra in which he participated.\nFor more interviews about the Music School at the Henry Street Settlement see Baron, Samuel; Behrend, Louise; and Canin, Martin."

The interview covers Kahn's childhood and family.  Kahn discusses the different apartments in which her family lived in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and the ways in which the family members negotiated privacy for themselves in the apartment.  She describes their neighbors and her friends from school.  She describes her parents, siblings, and extended family who lived with them. She recounts the sewing, washing, and cooking her mother did for the family and describes her father's work casting the metal type for the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eJewish Daily News\u003c/span\u003e in the LES.  She explains that he would bring home the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eJewish Daily News\u003c/span\u003e and other Yiddish newspapers, which Kahn and her siblings would read to their parents.  She discusses her father losing his job when the Jewish Daily News closed and her parents' decision to become janitors in order to save money on rent.\nSee also:  Kokofsky, Abraham"

The interview covers Kalawsky's early life in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and her family.  Throughout the interview, Kalawsky describes her family's apartments in the LES, living arrangements in the apartments, appliances in the apartments, the ways in which the family members negotiated privacy for themselves in the apartment.  She discusses her parents' responsibilities as the janitors in the buildings in which they lived.   She discusses her mother, her jobs outside of the home, and her feelings about working outside of the home, in particular her enjoyment of discussing politics with her coworkers.  She discusses her father's work for the City of New York as a watchman on construction sites.  She discusses her parents' relationship and their immigration experiences.  She discusses her Irish neighbors, a Catholic church in her neighborhood to which she wanted to belong, and the fact that she wanted to be Irish rather than Russian.  Kalawsky discusses the death of her oldest sister from spinal meningitis when she was seven years old and her mother's feelings about illness in the family after the death of her daughter.  She discusses her relationship with her parents, the fact that her mother worried over her safety and the games and skills her father taught her.  She recalls her memories of the different ethnic groups that lived together in the LES, in particular the foods of each group and her opinion that the diversity was beneficial to the people living in the neighborhood.  Other topics include traditions in her home during Easter and Christmas and games she would play with her friends."

The interview covers Michael Katz's life in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York and his involvement in the Henry Street Oldtimers at the Henry Street Settlement in the LES.  At the beginning and end of the interview, Katz discusses the work of the Henry Street Oldtimers at the Henry Street Settlement and members of the Oldtimers.  He discusses the reasons for the creation of the Oldtimers in 1938 and the importance of the Henry Street Settlement to him, his friends, and his brothers as children.  He discusses his role as president of the Henry Street Settlement Federal Credit Union and recounts the creation of the credit union.  He discusses his childhood in the LES, his reasons for joining the Henry Street Settlement, and activities in which he participated there.  He discusses his father's working life, the family's living arrangements in small apartments in the LES, and his parents' immigration experiences.  He discusses his education, his dislike of school, and his preference for meeting friends in pool halls rather than attending school.  He recounts his family's reaction to his brother's marriage to a Catholic and the fact that his mother would not speak to him for two years after his marriage.  He discusses organizations in which he was involved at the time of the interview and his volunteer work through the Henry Street Settlement and an unspecified Masonic lodge.  Other topics include his siblings and his work as a salesman."

Kertman describes the LES as very crowded and explains that he thought the majority of the residents had become Americanized and that he felt excluded because of this.  Kertman discusses his feelings about this Americanization and he disapproval for the immigrants who, in his opinion, had abandoned their home country's language, attitude and general way of life.  He explains that he found purpose and community within the Communist Party of the United States of America because they were activity in the community and stood for causes that he felt would better society."

The interview covers Philip Kiriakos's childhood, family, and experiences as a tenant of the Vladeck Houses.  He describes his daughters and discusses the deaths of his elder daughter in 1983 and his wife in 1988.  He recounts learning about the Vladeck Houses and being one of the first families to move into the apartments.  He discusses the differences between life in the tenements and Vladeck Houses, including having bathrooms inside the apartment and having rent determined by the occupants' salaries.  He discusses crime in the Vladeck Houses and other housing projects at the time of the interview and his opinion that the Vladeck Houses are better than other housing projects.  He discusses his neighbors and his decision to stay in the Vladeck Houses because of his relationship with one family.  He recounts life in the tenements in the 1910s and 1920s, including Christmas and New Year's traditions, trolleys in front of the buildings, and ways to keep cool in the summer.  Other topics include his participation in a theatre group at the Church of St. James in Manhattan and different jobs he held."

Koblenz describes her family's apartment on Eldridge Street in the LES, the living arrangements, and her neighbors in her building.  She discusses traditions in her family surrounding Passover and her father's responsibilities as the sexton in their synagogue.  Other topics include vermin in the family's apartment, her mother's home remedies, fires in the LES, and games Koblenz would play with her friends on the street."

He discusses his and his siblings' education and their leaving school in order to work to support the family.  He discusses his childhood friends and his feelings about non-Jewish people as a young person.  He discusses his participation in a choir in an unspecified synagogue, despite the fact that his family were not strictly observant.  He describes his parents and discusses his relationship with them, in particular his negative feelings about his mother and his preference for his father.  He discusses his membership in the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union when he worked in the garment industry and his membership in the American Postal Workers Union when he worked for the United States Postal Service.  Other topics include the family's experiences during the Great Depression, his siblings' working lives, and his friendships with Zero Mostel and his brother that developed in the synagogue choir."

Over the next five years, the family moved to five different apartments within the LEs.  When he was nine years old, Landres and 14 of his classmates formed a club called the Wilson Club.  Landres was an active member of the Henry Street Settlement in Manhattan and worked at Camp Henry."

The interview covers Markowitz's early life in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and her family.  Markowitz discusses her parents, including their immigration experiences.  She describes the apartments in which her family lived in the LES, including the layouts, the amenities and utilities, and the living arrangements in the apartments.  She discusses social and leisure activities in which she participated in the LES and recalls attending summer camp outside of New York City.  She discusses her experiences during the Great Depression and her feelings about her family having to accept home relief benefits and the way in which her family was viewed because of this.  She discusses organized crime in the LES and her friends who became involved in organized crime.  She discusses the apartments in which she lived with her husband and their children and recounts her reasons for moving from the LES to Long Island.  She recounts the deaths of many of her family members, including her first husband, in 1982.  She describes herself as a happy person despite the difficulties she faced throughout her life.  She describes her brothers, their military service during World War II, and her relationship with them.  She discusses one of her uncles, her dislike of him, and his relationship with her father.  She recalls her memories of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg before and after their trial and execution, her opinions on their case, and the ways in which the community in the LES reacted to their conviction and executions."

The interview covers Marrin's experiences as a member of the Board of Directors at the Henry Street Settlement in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York and her working life.  Marrin discusses the beginning of her involvement with the Henry Street Settlement as a volunteer in the Drama Department and Pete's House Productions working with Joseph Balfior.  She discusses ethnic and racial tensions in the LES and the ways in which the staff of the Drama Department sought to teach the children and teenagers how to resolve them.  She recounts her idea to coordinate the drama, dance, and music programs as a unified arts program at the Settlement and the fact that this led to her invitation to join the Board of Directors in 1966.  She explains that she became involved in fundraising activities, continued with her drama classes, and worked as a nurse until she had children and no longer had time to dedicate to volunteering.  She recounts her decisions to leave her nursing position in 1973, to become a lobbyist in Albany for a state senator for ten years, and to enroll in law school at Pace University in Manhattan.  She discusses the creation of the Settlement's Art Show between 1987 and 1989 and her idea to have it at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan.  She describes Jimmy Robinson, the head of the Youth Program, and his Cavaliers program, and the leader of the Youth Program at the time of the interview.  Other topics include the creation of the Settlement's Urban Family Center and Arts Center, her experiences as a lobbyist, and the Friends of Henry Street."

The interview covers Miller's life in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and his family.  Miller discusses his parents, their immigration experiences, and their working lives.  He describes his family's apartment in the LES, the layout, and the amenities and utilities in the apartment.  He recalls home remedies his mother would use, his opinion of doctors, and he and his brother being quarantined for diphtheria.  He describes his father's work as a carpenter, his carpentry business, and his customers.  He discusses the schools he attended.  He describes the ethnic boundaries in the LES, the fact that he and his friends were careful of staying in the Jewish sections of the neighborhood, and animosities between Jewish, Italian, Russian, and Polish residents of the LES.  He recounts his relationship with his father and the differences between parenting in the 1920s and 1930s and at the time of the interview, in particular the importance placed on fathers spending time with their sons in 1990s.  He describes his work as an electrician with his brother after his graduation from high school and after his discharge from the Navy after World War II.  He discusses his career as a sales manager for a brick company.  He recounts activities and events he attended at settlement houses and states that he would never attend events at the University Settlement as it was located in the Italian section of the LES.  Other topics include his relationship with his siblings, his experiences in the Navy during World War II, shopping in the LES in the 1930s and 1940s."

He discusses the decline of the Yiddish language, the Spanish Civil War, and compares anarchism in the period between the 1950s and 1970s to politics in the United States (US) at the time of the interview.  Miller describes the Lower East Side to be located below Fourteenth Street and East of Second Avenue.  He references the book, Fragments, written by Sam Dolgoff throughout his interview and relates that Dolgoff played an active role in the anarchist movement during the twentieth century in the Lower East Side (LES).  Miller explains the tension between various ethnic groups in the LES, including gang fights between Jewish, Irish, and Italian residents and relates his opinion that between 1900 and 1940 neighborhoods were the center of people's lives."

Muse discusses his participation in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), including his first interactions with the organization as a teenager, his opinions on legal successes of the organization, and the effect these events had on him.  He recounts his time in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, including the apartment in which he lived, his neighbors, and the stores at which he shopped.  He discusses his studies with Paul Lazarsfeld in the Bureau of Applied Social Research at Columbia University and a research study Muse conducted on intercultural relations in the LES.  He recounts his work for the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) and his adoption of HIAS's fundraising strategy when he worked at the NAACP."

The interview covers Lorraine Cohen Nussenblatt's family and her experiences in different housing projects in New York City.  Nussenblatt recounts moving into the Vladeck Houses with her mother and two siblings in 1940 as one of the first residents.  She discusses her family's reasons for moving to the Williamsburg Houses in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn and then to the Vladeck Houses, and describes the two housing projects.  She discusses social activities at the Educational Alliance in the LES, including dances, Hebrew classes, and sewing classes, and states that she still attended events there at the time of the interview.  She discusses her duties as an air raid warden during World War II and as an officer in the Vladeck Houses Tenants Association at the Vladeck Houses.  She discusses an informal loan association provided through the Vladeck Houses Tenants Association.  She discusses the activities in which she participates through the Good Companions Senior Center at the Henry Street Settlement in the LES.  She discusses her parents, including their immigration to the United States, their meeting at an unspecified socialist club in New York, and her mother's struggle after her husband's death."

The interview covers Nora O'Malley's childhood in Ireland, her family, and her experiences as a cook at the Henry Street Settlement in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  O'Malley can sometimes be hard to hear.  She describes her family and her childhood in Ireland, including her house and chores, her siblings, and her relationship with her parents.  She recalls social and leisure activities in the village near her family's farm and Christmas and birthday traditions.  She discusses the differences in cooking when she first came to the Henry  Street Settlement in the 1930s and later in her career, specifically having machines to assist in peeling and cutting vegetables and frozen foods.  She recounts different apartments in which she lived in the LES before she moved into 267 Henry Street, one of the buildings managed by the Henry Street Settlement, and describes her apartment.  She describes the other cooks with whom she worked, their responsibilities, and types of meals they cooked.  Other topics include Helen Hall and Thanksgiving at the Henry Street Settlement.\nSee also:  Beck, Bertram; Gold, Leona; \nMcGee-Robinson, Audrey Peters"

Platin discusses living in a tenement on East Broadway in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, which she remembers as being in better condition compared to other buildings in the LES. She describes moving to Knickerbocker Village in the LES. Platin discusses services provided by the Henry Street Settlement in Manhattan during the Great Depression, such as food stamp distribution, assistance with the Department of Welfare (likely a city department), and organizing boat rides for mothers and children in the summer. Platin discusses the deaths of relatives in Poland during pogroms and illnesses experienced by family members, including diabetes and tuberculosis. She talks about her sadness over the death of her maternal grandmother when she was five years old, and discusses Jewish customs and practices surrounding death. Platin discusses living in Brooklyn as a young mother and the careers of family members."

Laist at Bernard Rosen's house in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.  The majority of the interview covers Rosen's childhood in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  Occasionally, Rosen's wife, Elizabeth Rosen, can be heard correcting him.  Rosen recalls living in dumbbell tenement on Henry Street that had both internal plumbing and heat.  He recalls living around the corner from his paternal grandparents and remembers weekend family meals at their apartment.  Rosen recalls his grandmother keeping fish in the bathtub in the kitchen before cooking them.  Rosen discusses his father's grocery store and it being closed by the city in order to build the Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia Houses.  He talks about his negative experiences at Catholic school and his acceptance into the Intellectually Gifted Children Program at Public School 33 (PS33).  Rosen recalls spending time at the Lower East Side Garden Cafeteria and Union Square to attend political talks and rallies."

Laist at Elizabeth Flynn Rosen's office at the Pierpont Morgan Library in Manhattan, New York.  The majority of the interview covers the immigration of Rosen's maternal grandparents and their life experiences in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  Rosen describes how her maternal grandfather left his parent's home at 12 years old and traveled across Poland and Russia.  She discusses her grandmother's success as a seamstress making children's pinafores and dresses in the Lower East Side and how this success led to the family's children's clothing factory.  Rosen states that her grandfather started the concept of standard children's clothing sizes.  She describes her grandfather as an idealist, who believed strongly in the capitalist system and the business opportunities it presents."

The majority of the interview covers Julius Schatsky's childhood and life in a Jewish household in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  Schatsky recalls living in three different apartments on Henry Street.  He describes one of the family's apartments, including a bathtub in the kitchen with a removable cover that functioned as additional counter space, and the shared bathroom in the hallway.  He speaks fondly of his many neighborhood friends and the street games they played together.  He remembers joining the Cub Scouts at the Educational Alliance in the Lower East Side and attending a summer picnic sponsored by the Henry Street Settlement in White Plains, New York.  "

The majority of the interview covers Schatsky's childhood and life in a Jewish household in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  Schatsky recalls moving from 253 Henry Street to 254 Henry Street and his opinion that the latter was more modern because it had a bathroom inside the apartment rather than in the hallway.  He describes feeling a sense of inferiority when he would accompany his mother on her trips to the welfare office during the 1930s and 1940s.  Schatsky states that the street and the Henry Street Settlement in the Lower East Side provided space for the neighborhood children to play together.  He also discusses his philosophical opinions about being Jewish, the importance of friendship, and his love for New York City.  See also Julius Schatsky's interview."

The majority of the interview covers Norman Shapiro's family's winery.  Shapiro recalls thousands of people lining up outside the winery during Passover in order to purchase wine.  He states that since the opening of their store, his family made and sold their own wine.  Shapiro explains that he was 12 years old when he first started working at the family winery in order to assist with bottling the wine.  He suggests that, at the time of the interview, the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan had changed from a primarily Jewish neighborhood to include people from Puerto Rico and China.  Shapiro argues that people were happier during the 1940s and 1960s because their families lived closeby and were able to share in traditions like the Passover seder.  He expresses his opinion that the LES has been affected negatively with the shift of immigrant populations."

The interview covers Simon Shulman's early life in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan.  Sylvia, a friend of Shulman's whose first name is not given, occasionally participates in the interview.  Throughout the interview, Shulman shows Groen awards he received, posters he created, and photographs.  Shulman discusses his parents' immigration experiences and describes his family's apartments on Houston Street in the LES.  He recounts the amenities in the apartments, living arrangements, chores for which each family member was responsible, the fact that his father's sign shop was in the basement of one of their apartments, and his memories of the food store Russ \u0026 Daughters which was on the ground floor of one of the buildings in which they lived.  He discusses his education and career, his work creating posters for theatres in New York City, and his decision to teach commercial art.  He recounts posters he created for the Academy of Music on Fourteenth Street in Manhattan, Yiddish and other theatres, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and the National Broadcasting Company (NBC).  He relates stories about his students at George Westinghouse Vocational and Technical High School in Brooklyn.  He discusses his father's sign shop and businesses for which he created signs.  He describes saloons in the LES and recounts buying beer for his father from a saloon near his apartment.  He discusses contentious relations between Jewish, Italian, and Irish residents of the LES, including fights he had with Italian children in the LES.  \nOther topics include awards Shulman won at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, a fire in a leather factory in the LES when Shulman was a child, anecdotes about the LES, and organized crime in the LES."

Berman at Rose Singer's apartment in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.  The interview covers Singer's experiences in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and at the Henry Street Settlement in the LES, particularly as a member of the Alcott Club.  Singer describes the Vladeck Houses in the LES and recounts moving there in 1940.  She discusses her membership in the Alcott Club at the Henry Street Settlement, her participation in other events and activities at the Settlement, and her friends at the Settlement.  She explains that she developed confidence through these activities at the Settlement.  She discusses her early life in the LES, her unhappiness at moving to the neighborhood as a teenager after the death of her father, and compares the LES with Yonkers in the 1920s and 1930s.  She recounts her early working life in the early 1930s as a children's clothing inspector and the working conditions in the factory in which she worked.  She discusses her parents and the ways in which her mother supported the family after her husband's death in 1927.  "

She discusses the settlement houses' social programs and the ways in which they benefited the LES.  She discusses the sense of community she felt at the Henry Street Settlement and the freedom she felt being away from her young children and her husband for a short time.  She explains that her husband at first resented her involvement with the Settlement, his resentment at having to care for their children while she went out, and her resentment of his leisure activities and the double-standard that existed in their family.  She describes holiday activities at the Settlement, in particular the fact that the different ethnic and religious groups at the Settlement would work together to create inclusive events before Irish and Italian members formed separate groups based on ethnic identities.  She describes the Settlement programs in which the Alcott Club took a particular interest, including working for better housing in the LES, a cooperative milk program, and clothing swaps.  Other topics include her memories of the Great Depression, discussion of her husband's working life, and her memories of Helen Hall."

A second interview was conducted on April 7, 1993 by Halvorson at Solomon's house.  The main topics of the interviews include Solomon's knowledge of members of the Vanguard Group, an anarchist political group active during the 1930s in New York City and her experiences living in the Ferrer Colony in Stelton, New Jersey.  Solomon recalls her parents hosting gatherings at the family's apartment on Avenue B and Twelfth Street in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan at which anarchism and the Modern School Movement were discussed.  She discusses her parents' decision to join the Ferrer Colony and describes the house her parents built in the Colony.  Solomon recalls her physical education teacher, James Dick, and her enjoyment of soccer and basketball as a child.  She reflects fondly upon her life at the Colony and states that the community evoked an atmosphere of freedom."

Laist at Sally Spiro Stern's apartment in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  The interview includes both audio and video recordings.  The majority of the interview covers Stern's memories of her family, in particular her grandfather, Louis Borgenicht and her father, Jack D. Spiro.  Stern's description and opinions of her grandfather differ from what is expressed in Harold Friedman's biography of him, \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eThe Happiest Man: The Life of Louis Borgenicht\u003c/span\u003e.  She argues his book describes him as a positive, fair minded, and hardworking man when he was actually very unpleasant and cold.  Stern also argues that it was her grandmother who had the successful business ideas, not her grandfather.  She explains the emphasis on Jewish traditions in her family, including family dinners, marriage, and the importance of education.  Stern recalls the sense of community amongst Jewish people in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  She describes her first experience of anti-semitism at the University of Michigan in the mid 1940s."

Her parents immigrated to the United States (US) from Poland in the early 1900s.  Her maternal grandfather was the schochet, or ritual slaughterer, for the Jewish community of Newark, New Jersey.  In 1923, Weinstein's parents married and moved to the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn.  Her father managed a wholesale leather business in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan.  After the birth of her eldest brother, the family moved to an apartment on Henry Street in the LES.  After the death of her father when Weinstein was two years old, her mother managed the business and raised her five children.  Between 1937 and 1955, the family lived in a three bedroom apartment on Madison Street in the LES.  She earned her bachelor's degree in sociology and psychology from City College in Manhattan.  Weinstein worked as a psychiatrist at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens.  During her 20s, Weinstein travelled and worked in Israel for a few years, before returning to the US and working at Columbia-Presbyterian Clinic located in Upper Manhattan.  She married in 1964 and had children.  The family moved to the Fresh Meadows neighborhood of Queens, where she lived at the time of the interview."

The majority of the interview covers Beverly Fischer Weinstein's childhood experiences being raised by her widowed mother in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  She vividly describes the family's apartment on Madison Street in the LES apartment and the fact that it was an entire floor of the building and a railroad style apartment.  Weinstein discusses the fact that their apartment was near her family's leather business.  She discusses her friends' reactions to her apartment and to the LES and their comparisons between the LES and  the neighborhoods in which they lived in upper Manhattan.  Weinstein recalls visiting the Educational Alliance and being a member of the Young Israel Synagogue of Manhattan.  She discusses the importance of family; weekly Sunday visits from relatives who lived in Newark, New Jersey; and her participation in many weddings.  She expresses pride in her education and work experiences and explains that she was glad she waited until she was about 30 years old to get married.  Weinstein states that she enjoyed her independence and argued that it allowed her to gain meaningful experiences which she might not have been able to have if she had gotten married and started a family at an earlier age."

Weiss immigrated to the United States in 1953.  He lived with his uncle in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York before moving to the  Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn.  Weiss's first job was in a leather jacket factory on Hester Street in the Lower East Side.  He later worked for his uncle, who was a wholesaler and distributor of underwear.  Around 1960, Weiss opened his own wholesale and retail shop on Orchard Street in the Lower East Side."

Weiss discusses the difficulties he faced getting his immigration papers.  He remembers having to travel around Russia for the required documents and physical examination.  Weiss recalls purchasing the space that became his wholesale and retail business.  He states that the ethnic demographics of the neighborhood had changed from predominantly Jewish and Eastern European in the 1960s to Chinese and Hispanic at the time of the interview.  Weiss shares his opinion that the growth of department stores in the Lower East Side has increased at the time of the interview and was hurting local businesses."

The interview covers Zweibach's early life in the LES and her family.  Zweibach describes the apartments in which her family lived in the LES, the amenities and utilities, the layouts, the living arrangements, and the ways in which the family members negotiated privacy for themselves.  She describes her relationship with her brother, in particular her resentment of him when they were children and their relationship at the time of the interview.  She discusses her father's jobs, including losing his work as an egg candler when machines were introduced to do that work, and his work as an unskilled laborer in various temporary jobs.  She discusses her family's finances while her father could not find permanent work, her parents becoming janitors in one of the buildings in which they lived, and the shame of having to receive home relief benefits during the Great Depression.  She recounts gaining a job as a summer school teacher in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens through the Works Progress Administration.  She describes her mother, including her relationship with her brothers and her feminism, which Zweibach credits for her receiving a college education and becoming a professional.  Other topics include her jealousy over her brother's religious education, her love of the public library and reading, and her membership in the Workmen's Circle in Manhattan."

His parents sent Akiya and his siblings to Japan for their education in 1915. Akiya returned to the US in 1932, giving up his dual Japanese citizenship, in order to escape being drafted into the Japanese Army. During World War II he was interned at the Topaz War Relocation Camp in Utah. Akiya worked at two banks, the Office of Strategic Services, a furniture store, and at the University of Michigan as a Japanese teacher. In 1987, Akiya received the Martin Luther King, Jr. Award for Community Organizing."

Akiya discusses the experience of being Japanese American, his education in Japan, his career, and his participation in civil rights movements in the United States (US). Akiya describes the discrimination experienced by Japanese people in the US, including anti-immigration laws and internment camps during World War II. He discusses his experience as one of the kibei, Japanese Americans who left the US for schooling in Japan.  He discusses traveling to Washington, DC in order to get a job with the Office of Strategic Services during World War II. Akiya describes moving to New York City and working at a Japanese bank where he observed discriminatory hiring practices against blacks and latinos. Akiya describes working as a finisher in a furniture factory and becoming a union representative (likely in the United Furniture Workers of America). Akiya discusses his involvement in both civil rights and anti-nuclear movements; he discusses trying and failing to see Malcolm X on the day he was murdered and going to anti-apartheid meetings in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. He describes receiving the Martin Luther King, Jr. Award for Community Organizing."

Her parents met after emigrating from Japan; her father attended the University of California, Berkeley, and her mother traveled to California after the end of her first marriage. Iijima's father started a Japanese-language newspaper in which her mother published poetry. Iijima attended the University of California, Berkeley. During World War II, she was moved first to the Tanforan Assembly Center in San Bruno, California and then to the Topaz Internment Camp near Delta, Utah. She married her husband, Tak Iijima in Salt Lake City, Utah. Iijima followed her husband, who was in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, to Camp Shelby in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where she worked in the United Service Organization. In 1945 or 1946 she moved to New York City and edited the Japanese American Committee for Democracy newsletter. In 1948 she gave birth to a son and a daughter. Iijima was active in protesting the Vietnam War and co-founded a political group, Asian Americans for Action, in 1969 with Minn Matsuda."

It covers Elba Valentin de Garcia's and her husband's lives in Nicaragua, in the United States (US), and their family.  The Garcias discuss their lives in Nicaragua and compare life in the US with life in Nicaragua, particularly the differences between their experiences and their daughters' experiences. Garcia discusses the Nicaraguan Revolution and the fact that it led his family to immigrate to the US.  He recounts working in a sugar mill that was confiscated by members of the Sandinista National Liberation Front and his difficulty finding work as he did not support the Sandinistas.  He discusses the political views of the Sandinistas and the disillusionment felt by their early supporters when they came to power.  Other topics include land redistribution due to agrarian reform in Nicaragua."

The interview covers Eddy's early life in Connecticut, his experiences during World War II, and his experiences in East Harlem as a Protestant minister.  Eddy describes New Britain, Connecticut and discusses the relationship between the Yankee residents and the immigrants who settled in New Britain in the early 20th century.  He describes his grandparents, their personalities, and their influences on him.  He describes his experiences during World War II (WWII) and recounts his duties a volunteer ambulance driver with the American Field Service in northern Africa and the Middle East.  He compares the experiences of soldiers during WWII and those who served in the Vietnam War, and the impressions he had of how American civilians perceived the experiences of soldiers and civilians living in countries affected by the war.  He explains that after his service in the war, he decided to take time to decide what career he wanted for himself.  He recounts his experiences between 1944 and 1948, traveling throughout the United States, working on farms, and learning about different religions.  He describes a spiritual experience he had during WWII in Syria, and his interest in Buddhism, Islam, and mystical parts of Judaism.  He explains how this experience inspired him to serve the spiritual needs of people and his belief at the time that this would not be possible in established Protestant churches.  He recounts taking courses at the Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan in 1945.  He discusses his work as a farm laborer in different areas of the United States between 1945 and 1948 and studying in New York City during the winters.  He recounts enrolling full time at the Seminary, working in East Harlem, and joining the East Harlem Protestant Parish and moving to East Harlem in 1949.  He describes the sense of community he witnessed in East Harlem amongst the Puerto Rican, African American, Eastern European, and Italian residents of the neighborhood.  He explains that while everyone was aware of the ways in which their neighbors were different from them, they were connected by the fact that they were neighbors and lived together.  He discusses the work of the Metro North Citizens' Committee and the Parish to ensure the residents of the neighborhood had adequate housing.  He discusses the ways in which public housing projects positively and negatively affected the community and compares them to the tenements they replaced."

The majority of the interview covers Abdourahmane Sarr's experience as a student in Dakar, Senegal and his adjustment to life in New York City.  He discusses the fact that he found learning English to be difficult, but found it to be a necessary skill he needed to learn in order to live in the United States (US).  At the time of the interview, Sarr had been in the US for less than a year and was contemplating his future educational plans beyond Seward Park High School, including possibly attending an American university."

The majority of the interview covers Darline Tremont and Diedra L'Ouverture's childhoods in Haiti.  Tremont recalls growing up in a very structured household in which education held precedence.  She explains her reasons for not practicing one particular religion and describes her belief in a greater force that is beyond the basic human existence.  L'Ouverture recalls experiencing discrimination in each place she lived due to her family being practitioners of Vodou.  She explains that the pantheon of Vodou brings her comfort and security.  She discusses her experiences in the various countries and states in which she lived prior to New York City.  Both Tremont and L'Ouverture discuss the common perceptions of Haitians and provide examples of discrimination they have faced, mostly regarding the common idea that Haitians are all poor and uneducated."

Baruch Houses in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of  Manhattan, New York.  The majority of the interview covers Davenport's childhood experiences growing up during the Great Depression in the LES.  She recalls standing in bread and soup lines with her mother and great-grandparents.  In the 1930s, Davenport's parents were not able to support the family financially and sent Davenport and her three siblings to a shelter at the Church of Saint Catherine of Genoa in Manhattan.  Davenport and her siblings remained at the shelter for about a month until her father regained employment.  She attended high school at the Metropolitan Vocational School in Manhattan.  Davenport received leave from high school so that she could assist her mother with caring for her sister who had poliomyelitis.  Davenport discusses the jobs she held as a teenager, including seamstress, babysitter, housecleaner, and as a mail clerk at American Steel in Brooklyn."

Karp discusses his parents and grandparents, their immigration experiences, and their lives in the LES.  He describes the ethnic divisions in the LES in the early decades of the 20th century.  He discusses his education and the schools he attended in the LES.  He recounts customs in his family and in the LES around the Jewish holidays.  He describes the apartments in which his family lived in the LES, the living arrangements, and the amenities and utilities in the apartments.  He discusses the changes in the ethnic composition in the LES after World War II when many Jewish residents moved from New York City to Long Island, New York and his opinions on why this change occurred."

He describes his religious education and studying for his bar mitzvah.  He describes his family's apartments in the Lavanburg Homes and the Bernard M. Baruch Houses in the LES.  He describes his father, his working life, and his reputation in the neighborhood as a friendly and helpful person.  He discusses his involvement in the Boys Brotherhood Republic in Manhattan, activities and events at the organization, and other members of the organization.  He discusses his family's move to the Seward Park Cooperative buildings in the LES and compares the buildings in the 1950s and the time of the interview.  He discusses his work at the New York City Board of Elections, including the positions he held there over 30 years and the reasons he remained at the Board.  "

He explains that the majority of the residents were Jewish and the reasons why the residents may not have wanted to accept Latino and African-American residents.  He states his opinion that the safety, cleanliness, and infrastructure of the buildings had declined after more Latino and African-American people moved into the buildings in the 1980s and 1990s.  He and his wife discuss social events and activities sponsored by settlement houses and the cooperative buildings in the LES, including trips, summer camps, and parties.  He discusses the history of the cooperative buildings in the LES and the fact that he learned about it through annual meetings and newsletters.  Other topics include his children and a discussion of crime in the LES in the 1940s through the time of the interview."

The interview focuses Jesus Ruiz's childhood and adolescence in the Bronx, New York, particularly his participation in organized stickball teams.  Ruiz discusses his parents' migration from Puerto Rico to New York and the different neighborhoods in which they lived in the Bronx.  He recounts his experiences learning English, attending school, and relearning Spanish when he returned to Puerto Rico in his 20s. He discusses his two marriages and his relationship with his daughter.  The majority of the interview consists of Ruiz discussing stickball culture in the Bronx, including the fact that each block in the Bronx had its own team, that teams generally reflected the ethnic and racial composition of the neighborhoods, and the organization of games between rival teams and blocks.  Ruiz discusses playing for the Sharks and the Young Devils when he was younger and playing for the Minotaurs at the of the interview."

The first 43 minutes of the recording are difficult to hear.  This recording consists of four individual interviews with John Stephens, George Murray, Ralph Munoz and Carlos Diaz.  The interviews cover each man's experiences playing stickball, with the most detailed interview being the one with Carlos Diaz.  Stephens, Murray, and Muno contribute only brief personal introductions.  Diaz recalls growing up in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan and discusses the influence of gangs on his childhood.  Diaz discusses his opinion on the importance of stickball and of providing children, teenagers, and adults in East Harlem with community activities and organizations to encourage positive life choices and fellowship."

This recording consists of four individual interviews with Gary Torres, Louis Rentas, Henry Mambo, and Charlie Horse.  The interviews cover each man's experiences playing stickball.  Rentas and Mambo provide brief personal introductions.  The interviews with Torres and Horse are more detailed and include discussions of their personal lives.  Torres recalls the crowds of people who would gather to watch stickball games on Saturdays and Sundays in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  He discusses the fact that people would watch from their windows and fire escapes, and would often throw money to the players.  Horse explains how stickball provided him with a recreational and positive social outlet which helped him resist gang activities."

Kaminsky describes herself as a revolutionary and Trotskyite, and discusses her participation in the Young Communists' League and the Young People's Socialist League.  She recalls spending summers at 3A and describes attending social events there.  She remembers 3A organizing weekly picnics for the community during the summer where members would cookout, socialize and often get into conversations regarding politics.  Kaminsky explains her opinion of Jewish identity that involved being politically and socially responsible rather than overly religious."

His parents immigrated to the United States (US) from Russia in 1905.  Manson attended Public School (PS 89) in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan.  His parents owned a laundry shop on Orchard Street in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  He had a summer job at the Equinox Hotel in Vermont when he was 16 years old.  During the Great Depression Manson hiked across the US.  Upon his return to New York, he joined the Three Arrows Cooperative Society in Putnam Valley, New York.  Manson was a member of several political groups including the Young People's Socialist League, the War Resisters' League, and the Hebrew Free Loan Society.  He received his bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees from Columbia University in Manhattan and a law degree from Brooklyn College.  Manson worked for the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union as a labor mediator for the state of New York, and served as dean of Baruch College in Manhattan."

The majority of the interview covers Manson's childhood in the Harlem and Lower East Side (LES) neighborhoods of Manhattan and his experience at the Three Arrows Cooperative Society (3A)  in Putnam Valley, New York.  Manson recalls playing in the street in the LES, in particular running underneath horses.  He describes the poverty of his family and their neighbors.  Manson explains various political and socialist philosophies, and discusses his memberships to the Young People's Socialist League, the War Resisters' League, 3A, and the Hebrew Free Loan Society.  He goes into detail about his financial struggles as a young adult and how he borrowed money from the Hebrew Free Loan Society who offered interest-free loans to its members.  He discusses in detail the fundamentals of the Hebrew Free Loan Society and the types of loans services they provided for its members.  Manson explains that he joined 3A because it required its members to accept cooperative living principles, like common ownership of property, and overall community involvement.  He describes giving public speeches to the 3A community as well as to neighborhoods in Manhattan."

The majority of the interview covers Bernice Kaufman Nisinson's experiences as a member of the Young Democratic Socialists (YDS) and her interest in political and religious philosophies.  She recalls the large selection of student run clubs at James Madison High School in Brooklyn and the fact that she attended a meeting for each club as a way to decide which ones she would like to join.  Nisinson argues that it is important to develop your own life philosophy.  She spends a majority of her interview discussing general socialist and Jewish beliefs including the importance of education, the emphasis of family togetherness and carrying on traditions."

The narrators include residents of the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York; Asian American activists; Central American, African, and Caribbean immigrants who settled in New York City in the 1980s and 1990s; members of the Three Arrows Cooperative Society in Putnam Valley, New York; and residents of public and cooperative housing in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  The narrators who lived in East Harlem were members of the East Harlem Protestant Parish, stickball players, or were involved with the Young Lords activist organization.  The East Harlem Protestant Parish interviews cover the founding of the church and its work in East Harlem.  The stickball interviews contain discussions of different forms of stickball popular in East Harlem through the 1940s and 1960s and amateur and professional stickball teams in New York City from the 1940s to the time of the interview.  The interviews conducted with Asian American activists cover their participation in political and social movements, including Asian Americans for Action, Harlem Parents' Committee, and the Organization on African American Unity.  These interviews include discussions of the narrators' experiences in the internment camps in the western United States (US) during World War II and of discrimination.  The interviews with Central American, African, and Caribbean immigrants include discussions of immigration experiences, comparisons of life in the US and the narrators' countries of origins, and discrimination experienced by the narrators in the US.  The majority of the Central American narrators were Nicaraguan or lived in Nicaragua in the 1970s and 1980s, and relate their experiences of the Nicaraguan Revolution between 1979 and 1990.  The members of the Three Arrows Cooperative Society (3A) in Putnam Valley, New York describe the community and its principles and their participation other political and social organizations, including the Young People's Socialist League and the Workmen's Circle.  The Young Lords interviews discuss the history and activities of the organization in New York City in the 1970s and 1980s."

Burke discusses his experiences working as a warehouseman at the Western Electric Kearny Works in Kearny, NJ between 1929 and 1931 and working odd jobs after he was laid off in 1931.  He recounts his first experiences working as a longshoreman, including the type of work that was available during the Great Depression and extortion of the new workers on the docks.  He discusses the formation of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) Local 1247.  He discusses the work patterns on the docks, the formation of work gangs, and pay rates for different types of cargo.  He recounts becoming a foreman and the difference in work for longshoreman and foremen.  He lists the different ports in which he worked: Hoboken, Jersey City, and Edgewater in New Jersey, and Staten Island and Brooklyn in New York.  He explains the ways in which information was disseminated about which ports had work.  Other topics include strikes and organized crime involvement in the ILA and on the docks."

Researchers may view an item's original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that have already been digitized are noted in the collection's finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will respond to you with further information."

The majority of the narrators lived in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Other narrators lived in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan or were members of the Asian American political movements or the Three Arrows Cooperative Society in Putnam Valley, New York.  The narrators reflect the changing ethnic composition of different neighborhoods in New York City, and include Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe; immigrants from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Central America; and migrants from the southern United States and Puerto Rico.  Topics covered by the interviews include life in tenements in the LES, life in public and cooperative housing in the LES, family life, ethnic identities, intercultural and interracial relations in New York City, education, religion, paid and unpaid work, immigration and migration experiences, religious and social activities in East Harlem, Asian American activism, socialist and anarchist organizations, and political activism.  In addition to the interviews, the collection includes transcripts (full and partial) of interviews, notes on and indexes of interviews, field notes taken by interviewers, and preliminary questionnaires completed by narrators.  Some files include articles and ephemera created by the narrators or are related to the topics they discussed in the interviews."
