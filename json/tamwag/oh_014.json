By documenting the lives of immigrants and migrants who settled in New York, New York between 1900 and 1930 and compiling data on their family relationships, work patterns, and associational lives, Gutman hoped to reveal the ways in which people from rural, non-industrial areas adapted to the structured environment of the factory and the crowded city.

Gutman oversaw the entire project and taught courses designed to prepare the student interviewers for conducting the oral histories.  Virginia Yans-McLaughlin, then assistant professor of history at CCNY, co-managed the project with Gutman and directed undergraduate student interviewers.  Three junior faculty members, Leon Fink, William Eric Perkins, and Ari Joel Perlmann, conducted interviews and taught courses related to the project.  Ronald Grele, an oral historian, served as a consultant and provided direction on the oral history interviews and conducted training sessions for the interviewers.   "

This interview covers Sedrkk Accent's life in Saint Kitts; his work as a boxer and later, a coal trimmer and fireman aboard ships; and his eventual immigration to the United States in 1963.  Accent begins by recounting his career as a boxer and how he enjoyed it.  He notes that while his first wife was very supportive of his career, often sitting in the front row during many of his matches, his second wife held little love for the sport and his involvement with it.  He describes the infidelity of his first wife; the tempestuous nature of their relationship; his discovery of her affair with a local police officer; and the violent dissolution of their marriage.  Accent describes his career as both a trimmer and a fireman aboard ships that sailed to a variety of locations including England, Italy, Greece, Canada, the Netherlands, Argentina, and Santo Domingo.  He recounts switching from trimmer to fireman because the latter was a less labor intensive job.  Despite admitting that he was not the most diligent Seventh-Day Adventist, he spends a good portion of the interview explaining the philosophy of his religion including his view of God as merciful and wonderful; the concept of doing the right thing to each and every human being; the need to lend a helping hand wherever it was needed; and the importance of upholding the Sabbath."

She discusses the differences in religious observance between Jews in Poland and in the US.  She recalls working in different factories, including the Albert Waist Company, and describes how the ILGWU would often send workers into non-union shops in order to unionize them.  She recalls strikes in which she participated, including one at which she was arrested for pinching a strikebreaker.  Altman describes her happiness in being able to bring her mother and younger siblings over to the US.  She discusses her mother's reactions to life in New York City and her pleasure in having running water in their apartment.  Summary is available for this interview."

Artler attended school until she was fourteen, moving into the labor force as soon as she was able.  She worked predominantly in the garment district, making both children's and ladies' dresses, until shortly after her marriage.  Work was seasonally based, so Artler spent part of the year unemployed, varying from a month to half of the year.  While working in the factories, she became a member of an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union) and participated in both social and union activities."

This interview covers Bea (Gitlin) Artler's childhood in Poland; her immigration to the United States as a young child; and her life and work in the garment industry in New York, New York.  Artler briefly discusses her childhood in Poland, noting her father's occupation as a butcher, before moving on to describe her memories of her initial years in New York City living in the back of her father's butcher shop.  As business declined in their initial location, Artler recalls the way in which her family moved throughout the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Artler specifically notes that they moved to better themselves, whether through better rent or living arrangements.  She briefly describes her three years of school, placing more emphasis on the various jobs she held in garment factories making feather hat ornaments, children's dresses, and the fronts of ladies' dresses.  She describes the conditions of the factories in which she worked as being acceptable, neither exceptionally dirty or crowded.  She mentions the worker demographic as being split between Italians and Jews and that the two groups got along well within the workspace.  She notes the delineation of work between men, women, and children and the tension between the manager and the employees due to his extravagant lifestyle.  Artler notes that while she originally gave all of her wages to her parents in an effort to augment the household's income, she eventually contested this agreement and kept more of the money she earned.  She discusses her membership in an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union) and her participation in strikes for higher wages, shorter work weeks, and greater job security, all of which the union eventually succeeded in acquiring.  She recounts participating in union sponsored social events in order to stay informed about her community and going to movies and shows with the circle of friends that she made through the union.  Summary is available for this interview."

This interview covers Morris Bagno's childhood in Poland; his immigration to various European countries before, during, and after World War I; his immigration to Canada and the United States (US); and his life and work in the garment industry in New York and California.  Bagno begins by describing his childhood in Poland, noting that the industry in his town was much smaller than in the cities that he would encounter in the US.  He explains that he received the equivalent of a college education at his local yeshiva while working with his father in the timber industry.  He describes his decision to leave Poland in 1912 in order to avoid conscription into the army and to escape his father's orthodox Judaism.  He recalls his immigration to various countries in which he lived including England, Belgium, Denmark, and Canada before his immigration to the US in 1920.  He recounts the awe he felt at seeing skyscrapers upon his arrival in New York City, which formed a stark contrast to the rural town where he grew up.  He recounts working with his uncle for a short time before deciding to find a job on his own and his his uncle's belief that he was indebted to and dependent upon him.  He recalls joining the local chapter of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, which he remarked was special for its inclusion of women as members and the fact that women could hold high positions within the union leadership.  He discusses his progression from a tailor to union delegate to supervisor and liaison between workers and employers.  He mentions that he made sure to keep his home life and his work life separate as he did not want his wife becoming involved in union affairs or interfering in his affairs.  He notes that the passage of the Norris-La Guardia Act in 1932 and the National Labor Relations Act in 1935 mitigated the effects of the Great Depression by preventing lockouts and allowing for unionization.  He recalls temporarily relocating to Los Angeles, California in 1949 at the behest of the president of the union in order to deal with the rising tension in one of the locals between the Social Democrats faction, of which he was a member, and the Communist faction, who were viewed as dangerous to the union."

This interview covers Abraham Belson's childhood in Russia; his immigration to the United States (US); and his life and work in the garment industry in Massachusetts and New York.  Belson begins by describing part of his father's history, recounting a time when the Russian government forced the Jewish population to convert to a religion other than Judaism and his father's refusal and subsequent draft into the army for fifteen years.  Belson recounts his membership in an unspecified Jewish club (likely the General Jewish Labour Bund of Lithuania, Poland and Russia) aligned against the czar and the feeling that he had to work against an authority that was not concerned with his well-being.  He describes immigrating to the US; living briefly in Massachusetts; and moving to New York City where his family and many friends from his hometown lived.  He spends the rest of the interview focused on the happenings of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), which he joined in 1907.  He mentions an unsuccessful strike in 1907 that lasted 13 weeks, resulting in landlords evicting families from their homes when they were unable to pay rent and the fact that they had to beg in the streets until the union was forced to compromise.  He explains that the union reorganized between 1907 and 1910 and rallied for its first large general strike in 1910.  Belson describes the camaraderie that he felt with his fellow union members; the union events they attended together; and the picnics and other outings they had during their free time.  He notes that this was common in several tight-knit communities in Brooklyn, Bronxville, and other parts of New York that were populated predominantly by ILGWU members.  He recalls becoming a union officer in 1949, emphasizing that this position required that he earn the respect of both workers and management in order to be elected and reelected every year.  Belson describes how the conditions of the workplace for garment workers improved due to union influence, noting better wages, better job hours, more job security, and the fact that workers were no longer required to rent their own machines in order to work.  He shares an anecdote about a strike in Newark, New Jersey that resulted in a prolonged stalemate between management and the union and how he and other union members strongarmed the management to cooperate with the union liaison."

The audio recording for this interview is missing.  This interview covers Stella Bialon's life in Poland; her immigration to the United States (US); and her husband's involvement in both an unspecified hatters' union and an unspecified millinery trade union.  Bialon describes her childhood in Europe, noting that her family's wealth enabled her to attend school.  She discusses her parents' opposition to her marriage because of the economic disparity between herself and her husband.  She recounts that her brother owned a garment business in Manhattan, New York.  She explains that she came to the US in 1910 originally on a three month trip but stayed there permanently, later sending for her husband.  She describes her husband's dedication to Socialism; his position as secretary and later chairman of an unspecified millinery trade union; the dishonest business practices utilized by employers to monopolize both the garment industry and its workers; and the contrast in freedom of speech between Poland and the US.

This interview covers Ethel Bolton's childhood in England; her immigration to the United States (US) in 1901; and her life and work in New Jersey and New York.  Topics regarding Bolton's childhood in England include her mother's death when Bolton was five years old; the subsequent immigration of her father and older siblings to the US while she remained in England with her grandfather; and her father's second marriage in the US.  Bolton describes her father's work as a printer, noting that he held various jobs at newspaper companies from the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eReynolds's Weekly Newspaper\u003c/span\u003e in London, England to the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eNew York Daily News\u003c/span\u003e and the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eWall Street Journal\u003c/span\u003e in New York.  She explains that he was an active member of Typographical #6 of the International Typographical Union and was involved in various strikes which resulted in food rationing for his family.  Bolton describes her dislike for her stepmother, recalling that she often faked illness so that Bolton was required to stay home from school to care for her and attributes the various relocations between New York and New Jersey to her stepmother's antagonism towards neighbors and local ministers.

She recounts adopting his teenage children as her own.  She discusses the fact that her husband tended to treat her as if she were a child due to the age gap between them and that she made a point of following his rules except in voting.  She briefly recounts working as a caretaker for young children before working as a switchboard operator at two advertising agencies, the Geland Sumner Company and the Kudner Agency.  At Kudner, she describes her work in the checking department, reviewing advertisements from Nebraska to Texas.  She notes that the companies she worked for treated her extremely well, giving her bonuses at the end of the month, hosting holiday parties, and paying for a \"crying towel\" party when all of the employees over sixty-five were forced to retire.  She describes some of the jobs her husband held, which included a position at the Dictaphone Company; executive secretary at an unspecified advertising club; and a managerial position at the Empire State Building, granted to him by Alfred Smith when Bolton was unemployed during the Great Depression.  Other topics include her sister's missionary work in Africa; parts of her husband's history; her faith and involvement with the Church of Truth at Carnegie Hall in the Midtown neighborhood of Manhattan."

Topics include Katy Bottman's family in Romania; her experiences in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; her work in Cleveland, Ohio; her work in New York, New York; her education; and her views on labor unions.  She recalls her family in Romania, including her father's work as a businessman; the fact that her mother did not work outside of the home; and her family's wealth.  She discusses her early life in the United States (US), including living with her cousin in Pittsburgh and working in his custom tailoring shop; having to hide from inspectors because she was an underage worker; and being perceived as supportive of union members during strikes, while she worked at home for her cousin.  Bottman recalls her experiences in Cleveland, including meeting and marrying her husband; keeping house rather than working; and being referred to as a baby by the other wives in the community because of her age.  She recounts her husband opening his own dress factory, where he made over 200 dollars a week and employed more than 30 people."

She recalls that while men were often educated, women were not; that younger workers learned from the older workers who had been educated in Europe; and that one's position within the factory was partially determined by their education.  She recalls feeling proud that she taught herself to read and write English and feeling disappointed that she did not retain much of her Romanian language skills."

This interview covers Mary Brackett's childhood in Ireland; her immigration to the United States (US); and her life and work as a baby nurse in New York City.  Brackett discusses her early years in Ireland, briefly mentioning her education at Presentation Convent School.  Other topics from her childhood include the role of the local priest as an educational, moral, and political leader in the community; the strict morality that he conveyed to his congregation; and his tendency to take the side of the Irish when arbitrating disputes between English authorities and the local Irish population.  Brackett mentions the relationship between the Quakers and the Catholics in Ireland, noting that many of the Quaker children attended Catholic schools though they did not participate in their more religious aspects.  She discusses the history of her grandfather's life, including his eviction from his farm during the Great Famine (1845-1852) and his time as a woodland ranger.  "

Brackett notes that she and many of the other staff members who cared for the children were treated like family by their employers, often eating and traveling with them.  She emphasizes how she kept in touch with the family even when they moved to Larchmont, New York and how she attended one daughter's wedding.  She explains that she moved on to care for the children of comedian Fanny Brice, who also treated her as an equal.  "

Topics include Brawer's childhood and family; his work experience; his views on unions, politics, religion, and race; and his romantic relationships.  Brawer discusses his childhood in Polish Galicia, including his father's work in real estate and the fact that he was emotionally absent from his family; the Yiddish songs his mother would sing to him; his siblings, all of whom died in World War I and World War II; and his introduction to the Zionist movement.  He discusses the anti-Semitism of the working class in Galicia; the segregation of Jews in the community; and his lack of education there.  He describes his attempts to avoid the conscription into the Polish Army, including feigning a limp and bribing doctors to say he was injured; and immigrating to Germany in 1911 and to the United States (US) in 1912.  He recalls his time in Germany, including working in a kosher grocery store; having trouble finding work because he couldn't speak German; and wasting a majority of his money on entertainment.  Brawer recalls his life shortly after his immigration to the US, including the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society assisting with his entrance into the country; and his trouble finding work because he had no skills.  He discusses working for Jewish managers in non-union restaurants; owning failed embroidery factories; and working as a salesman in the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.  "

This interview covers Ernestine Brown's childhood in St. George, South Carolina; her migration to New York, New York; and her life and work as family nurse in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Brown discusses her childhood on a large plantation in St. George, where she helped grow and harvest peas, corn, cotton, and tobacco.  She notes that the plantation, granted to the family by the federal government due to her grandmother's Cherokee heritage, spread for miles and isolated them from the surrounding communities.  She explains that in order to keep the plantation self-sufficient, many of her family members assumed various roles within the community, with one of her cousins working as the schoolteacher and her great uncle and father working as preachers in the local church.  She discusses her grandmother's role as the matriarch of the family.  She recounts her move to Charleston, South Carolina, mentioning that she had never interacted with a white person before arriving in the city.  She focuses on the stifled interactions between the racial groups in the city, describing the influence of the Jim Crow laws; and the intense scrutiny that black residents faced from white police officers.  She describes the differences between the schools in St. George and in Charleston.    "

She discusses her initial impressions of New York City, conveying the security she felt in living there through anecdotes about sleeping on the roof and fire escapes, and keeping her door open at night.  Brown recalls how her husband found work through a Civilian Conservation Corps camp, which resulted in his Army service during World War II. She explains that she was wary of her husband when he came back from the Army, having heard stories of other veterans' changed demeanor and behavior.  Brown emphasizes the changes in Harlem as a strong black community developed in the wake of white flight.  She spends a considerable amount of time noting the differences among the churches in St. George, Charleston, and Harlem, noting that St. George's preachers focused more on serving the community and the preachers in Charleston and Harlem focused on more secular matters.  Brown later describes her husband's brief, but serious illness, which resulted in multiple hospital visits before he died at home by her side."

Antonio Buono and an unidentified friend frequently converse in Italian during the interview.  This interview covers Buono's childhood in Italy; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1934; and his life and work as a longshoreman in Brooklyn, New York.  Buono begins by describing his childhood on a small farm in Italy, recalling his father's immigration to the US in 1902 and his sporadic visits to Italy.  He recounts his and his twin brother's decision to immigrate to the US and join their father in Brooklyn, where Buono worked in a small provisions factory.  He recounts his decision to work as a longshoreman because of the flexibility of the work hours and the increase in pay.  He recalls that though the job was labor intensive, the fresh air, consistent hours, and waterfront view made the job much more bearable than factory work.  He describes how joining an unspecified union (likely the International Longshoremen's Association) in 1940 helped to maintain his wages and hours and explains that there were few strikes during World War II in order to maintain the war effort.  Buono describes the relationship among the Italians in Brooklyn, many of whom were longshoremen, and notes that although the immigrants from different parts of Italy could be clannish when they socialized, they would present a united front in the workplace.  Other topics include his leisure activities and Italian traditions that were kept alive in the United States."

Burke briefly discusses his childhood in Ireland, explaining how his family farm was passed down to his father; his brief education; and the emigration of his family from Ireland.  Other memories include the influence of the clergy in local government; the destruction of a nearby town by the Royal Irish Constabulary Reserve Force; and and the way in which this contributed to his decision to immigrate.  His early recollections of the US include his spur of the moment decision to leave Boston, Massachusetts; finding work in New York City hours after arriving; traveling around the US (including Nebraska and Illinois); and his employment with the New York City Board of Transportation.  Within his discussion of his time with the Board of Transportation, there is a detailed discussion about the hierarchy of workers and their mobility within the department; the racial integration of the workforce; the guarantee of 48 hours a week once hired; and his position manning a change booth at the 168th Street subway station.

Topics include Burton's life in Jamaica, his immigration to the United States (US), his work as a carpenter, and his union involvement. Burton begins by discussing his early life in Jamaica, including his parents dying when he was very young; his grandparents believing his father was an unfit parent;  and Burton's father raising his brothers while Burton was raised by his grandparents.  He recalls the educational system in Jamaica; and his attendance at school until he was 14 years old.  He discusses his work as a carpenter's apprentice; sharecropping and land distribution on his grandfather's farm; and social activities such as cricket and rounders. His first impressions of the US include his feeling of surprise when he first saw snow; his opinion that people worried less in Jamaica than they did in the US; and the fact that he had no intention of living in the US permanently.  While discussing his career, Burton mentions working in foundries before joining the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America Local 18 in 1926; and working for the Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression.  He also discusses racial tensions between carpenters, particularly their disputes when black workers earned equal pay."

The interview covers Lily Campanile's parents' background and immigration to the United States (US), her childhood in Illinois, her husband's working life, their marriage and family, her personal life, and members of her extended family.  Campanile discusses her father's life in Italy, his immigration to the US, and his work as a coal miner in Illinois.  She discusses her mother's childhood in Sicily, her work picking fruit as a child, and her immigration to the US.  She describes the ethnic composition of Louisville, Illinois, including the fact that hers was one of two Italian families and that most of the people in the town were Russian.  She also describes the ethnic composition of Benld, Illinois, which was mainly Polish and Russian, with her family being part of very small Italian minority.  She recounts how she met her husband; their engagement; and their decision to move from Chicago to New York.  She discusses his work scraping and painting ships in a Navy yard in New Jersey and his decision to become a longshoreman in order to work closer to home.  She discusses which piers he worked on in Brooklyn; the type of cargo he would help load; the unreliable nature of the work; and injuries he sustained at work.  She discusses her unhappiness at not having worked outside of the home, due to having to care for her mother as a young woman and then caring for her own children, and the isolation she felt as a result.  Other topics include not having time or money for leisure activities and her disappointment in missing out on these things as a young woman; double standards set by her parents for her and her brothers; her daughters' marriages and families; and her living situation at the time of the interview. An index is available for this interview."

Topics include Canossa's immigration to the United States (US), the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) Local 1814, his family life, and leisure activities that he participated in.  Canossa discusses his immigration to the US in 1923, including not returning to his ship when it made port; immigrating alone because his immigration was not planned in advance; and feeling glad that he immigrated to the US.  He discusses the ILA, including the fact that there was always a union on the waterfront; that there were no requirements for joining other than paying dues; and that union benefits did not begin until after World War II.  He recalls marrying an American woman; having four children; and the fact that he was married for 42 years at the time of the interview.  He discusses leisure activities he enjoyed, such as reading the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eDaily Mirror\u003c/span\u003e and an unspecified Italian newspaper; attending the opera; and traveling to upstate New York and Long Island for vacations."

Bruno Canossa was assisted by Mario Cinisomo, who helps Canossa explain his thoughts.  Topics include Canossa's childhood, his immigration to the United States (US), his working experience, and his labor union involvement.  Canossa recollects his early life in Italy, including his father working in the engine room on ships in a Navy yard and that his family had a comfortable living.  His early memories of New York, New York include jumping ship when the boat he worked on arrived in port; getting his first job through friends he met in New York City; having multiple roommates in order to save money; and learning English in night school.  Despite the fact that he immigrated on a whim, he did not consider immigrating to New York City a mistake.  He discusses socializing predominantly with members of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) and the Catholic Church; and frequenting cafes to spend time with other Italian immigrants.  He also discusses the differences between New York City in the 1920s and at the time of the interview, including money going farther and people acting respectfully.  He explains that he joined the ILA because he could not work without being in the union, and that union benefits did not start until after World War II.  He discusses working on long term projects out of state; and that longshoremen did not want their children to become longshoremen unless they were not good students."

The interview covers Caroline Lavecchia Cappeletti's childhood in Italy, her parents' immigration to the United States (US), her marriage, her extended family, and her social life.  Cappeletti discusses her childhood, including her parents' immigration to the US; her life in Italy with her grandfather; and her immigration to the US after his death.  She describes being introduced to her husband and having to meet him secretly because of the strict rules her father set for her behavior.  She describes the buildings and people in the West Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, including the fact that few Italians lived there.  She discusses her work in a dress factory; modeling dress samples while the manager altered them; and sewing buttons by hand and other pieces on sewing machines.  She also discusses her salary and the fact that the factory was not unionized.  She describes her living situation after her marriage: she and her husband lived with his four brothers and their wives, and the group bought two apartment houses.  She discusses financial difficulties they had and the fact that all of the women had to work in order for the group to afford the mortgage payments on the buildings.  She discusses her social life before and during her marriage, including taking boat trips along the Hudson River and dancing at the Roseland Ballroom."

Caravello discusses working with his father and older brother in a vineyard in Italy and grafting vines from France onto native vines.  He explains that a disease killed off the majority of the vines before his immigration to the US, but does not say whether this led to his decision to immigrate.  He explains that his father was the foreman of the vineyard; that a director and inspector would come from Rome every two weeks to oversee their work; and that they arranged for Caravello to attend high school.  He recounts his achievements in school proudly.  He discusses the fact that he immigrated to the US in order to work in vineyards in California but that his family and a good job in a nickel-plating factory kept him in New York City.  He recounts moving with his wife and baby to Madison, Wisconsin after five or six years in New York and working as a machinist."

The date of the interview is unknown.  A second interview was conducted by Leon Fink at the International Longshoremen's Association Union Hall on Court Street in Brooklyn, New York on April 4, 1973.  The main topics of these interviews include the lives of Cinisomo's parents; his employment prior to his involvement with the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) Local 1814; social issues within the ILA; and social activities in which he participated outside of the ILA.  Cinisomo discusses his father, including his positions as sergeant major in the Italian Navy and as a sailor on a Swedish merchant marine ship, and difficulties he had while working in the US due to his height, health issues, and illiteracy.  He discusses his mother being a housewife; her work assisting other Italian immigrants in the United States (US) with their paperwork; and his parents' arranged marriage in Italy.  Cinisomo discusses his educational experiences, including graduating from public school; attending high school at night; and taking some college classes sponsored by the Works Progress Administration (WPA).  He describes his employment before the ILA, including working in a laundry, a paper box factory, and as a grocery clerk, and his employment as an organizer in the WPA from the early 1930s until the start of World War II.  He recalls social issues within the ILA, including the fact that the Irish and Germans controlled the union; that Italian workers were confined to working in the holds of the ships; and that striking was difficult because the Irish controlled the ILA and the police department.  Cinisomo discusses leisure activities in which he participated, including attending church every Sunday; playing cards on his days off; and not playing sports because he was exhausted after his shifts. Index is available for the April 4th interview."

This interview covers Elizabeth Clanton's childhood in Alabama; her migration throughout the United States (US); her work as a nurses' aide; and her union activity.  She begins by describing her childhood in Atmore, Alabama.  She focuses on how Atmore was divided along racial lines, describing segregation in neighborhoods, schools, churches, and the movies; and the limited, strained social contact between members of the white and black communities.  She also describes learning how to read in school, which enabled her to read the newspaper for her parents, neither of whom were literate.

She describes meeting and marrying her first husband in Alabama despite her family's reservations about her being too young and her occupation as a domestic worker for various families in Atmore, a position that she acquired from her mother when the latter became ill.  She spends a great deal of time discussing her movement throughout the US, including moving to Cleveland, Ohio in order to find domestic work to support her children, whom she had left with her parents after she separated from her husband; receiving a certificate in practical nursing in Chicago, Illinois; and moving to Brooklyn, New York to live with one of her sons.  She recalls sending much of the money she earned back to her family and writing letters to her mother and children to accompany each paycheck. \n \nClanton discusses her union involvement, including being introduced to the idea of unions by organizer Jesse Olson while working at Beth Israel Hospital, as a nurses' aide, in Manhattan; going to various hotels in New York City for union meetings; discussing union activities with co-workers only on breaks or after work; and participating in a hospital workers' strike in 1959.  Clanton discusses her opinion that despite the union not supporting striking workers sufficiently she realized the benefits of belonging to a union; her appreciation of Local 1199 after her retirement; and the educational programs and social activities that Local 1199 provided."

Cohen discusses growing up in a predominantly Irish section of the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, in which his family was one of two Jewish families, and how his mother would be protected on her way home from local poker games by neighborhood ruffians.  He describes his work at the Herring-Hall-Marvin Safe Company, attaching safe doors and setting the combinations.  He describes his work as an electrician for industrial companies and being forced to leave this work due to his wife's illness.  He recounts his years playing baseball as a catcher and traveling with two teams, the Colonials and the Chambers Arrows."

This interview covers Cora Coker's childhood in Louisiana and Illinois; her migration to New York, New York; her jobs in domestic service and in factories; and her family.  Coker recounts her childhood in Hammond, Louisiana, noting that strawberry picking season interfered with her education.  She recalls Klu Klux Klan activity in her city; that white people owned many of the farms and businesses in the area; and the lynching of a woman named Emma Hooker.  She explains that her family generally had friendly relationships with white people, recalling that they lived on property owned by white people before her father built her family a house; that many people in her family were named after the family that owned the property on which they lived; and that that family sent them a wagon full of toys at Christmas.  She explains that her family moved from Hammond to Chicago, Illinois after her father lost his job for walking through a segregated railroad station and then fighting with the man who chastised him for it.  She compares Hammond and Chicago, noting that her neighborhood in Chicago was split between black residents and Polish residents but that there was no animosity between the groups.  She explains that she quit school because she saw no future in it."

She explains that she found various domestic worker positions through an employment agency and that she worked less frequently after having children.  She recalls a contrast between being content and in love and struggling to make ends meet during the Great Depression.  She describes the differences between her relationship with her mother and her children's relationship with her, focusing on her efforts to communicate with them, including having monthly family meetings.

Topics of discussion include  Annie Cole's childhood, education, work experience, and union involvement.  Cole briefly discusses her early life in Alabama and Texas; her education at the Tuskegee Institute; and the hardships she endured in attending college, including working long hours during the day and being too tired to study at night.  She spends a majority of the interview discussing her working life, including a 6 month internship at an unspecified hospital on 125th street in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York and her job as a dietary aide at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, New York, which she began in 1952.  She discusses in detail her reasons for joining Local 1199, including speaking with a strike organizer about her frustrations regarding taking on the work of the striking workers, in addition to her own.  Cole discusses issues that she faced once she was a member of the union, including not receiving the same pay as hospital employees with different job titles, even though they did the same work, and unfair scheduling and benefits.  She also discusses her struggles against management regarding workplace and pay discrimination throughout her career."

Topics include Maud Cowen's childhood, her immigration to the United States (US), her first impressions of the US, her employment, and her family.  Cowen recounts her early life in Jamaica including her large family; her father owning a farm and her recollection of shipping oranges in barrels and raising animals; and teaching herself how to make dresses.  She recounts immigration officials in the US not wanting Cowen to leave with her black cousin when she arrived in New York, New York.  Cowen discusses her negative first impressions of the US, including feeling out of place and crying every night; feeling that people were unfriendly; and that she never had enough money.  She recalls the US attempting to deport her to Jamaica or Great Britain during World War I and fighting the deportation.  Cowan discusses her employment, including working at an ammunition factory in New Jersey; working in a laundry pressing soldiers' uniforms; sewing dresses as part of a display in a shop window in the Garment District neighborhood of Manhattan; working as a kosher cook; and being a maid and companion in a hospital.  Cowen discusses her kosher cooking, including learning the skill from a friendly Jewish woman for whom she worked; cooking for individuals as well as catering parties; and leaving this line of work after being severely burned lighting an oven. She discusses her daughters in detail, including the fact that they were both well educated and married, that both wanted her to move back to Jamaica at the time of the interview; and that one daughter owns 40 acres of land with a large house and a maid."

She discusses her employment as a domestic worker for ten years and the ways in which she found jobs every year or two.  She discusses changing to factory work because it was less physically demanding and had regular hours; working for the Ideal Toy Company for about eight years; and returning to domestic work.  She recounts taking a job as a dietary aide at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan in 1953 and describes her responsibilities preparing food and food trays for patients.  She discusses the organization of the hospital workers at Mount Sinai into Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union in 1958 and 1959; an eight week strike at the end of 1958 and the beginning of 1959; an election between Local 1199 and an unspecified union; and her decision to vote for Local 1199 despite not knowing what they would be able to do for the workers.

Currieri begins by describing his childhood and education in Italy.  He notes his family's long history in maritime trade; his father's medal of honor in recognition of his 24 years of navigation service; and his own desire to become a marine officer.  He explains that he and his mother immigrated to the US in 1920, where they settled on North Portland Avenue in Brooklyn, New York.  Currieri recounts working for different companies, including Klein Brothers and Metro Candy Company, before learning the pressing trade from his brother.  He recounts working as a presser in different factories in the garment industry, including Levine Dress Company, Henry Goldstein, Glassman and Prince, and Geoffrey Beene, before opening  his own factory.

He especially emphasizes the contrast between the ideal of the American melting pot and the reality of the discrimination he and many other immigrants faced, recalling tension among the various European nationalities that settled in Brooklyn.  He explains that the membership of some ILGWU locals consisted exclusively of a particular nationality.  He notes that union educational and social activities alleviated tension between ethnic groups.  Currieri and his wife discuss the role of women in the factories; the different jobs that they held; and the unemployment gaps that permeated their careers due to marriage and caring for their children."

Davidson describes her unpleasant experience traveling in steerage to the US and her pride in being able to save enough money to buy first class passage for her mother and seven siblings.  She recalls working in different garment factories in New York, New York; learning to use a sewing machine; working with Jewish and Italian women; and overcoming the language barrier between herself and the Italians.  She discusses her membership in an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union), including participating in strikes and organizing shops for the union.  Other topics include Davidson's attempts to attend an unspecified night school in the US, despite multiple physical attacks by anti-Semitic boys at the school; wrapping candy and picking apples as a child in Belarus; and attending the opera and concerts at the Metropolitan Opera House and Carnegie Hall in Manhattan."

The date is unknown, and the location is likely the International Longshoremen's Association Local 1814 Union Hall in Brooklyn, New York.  The interview covers Vincent DeMatteis' family and his working life.  DeMatteis discusses his father, including his work as a real estate agent in Italy; his immigration to the United States (US); and his work as a longshoreman.  DeMatteis describes his own apprenticeship to a jeweler, including some of the training he received.  He discusses his decision to become a longshoreman, against his father's wishes, as he was unable to find work as a jeweler during the Great Depression.  He describes different jobs longshoremen performed, including unloading, checking, and sorting goods from ships.  He discusses differences on the waterfront between the 1930s and the time of the interview, many of them being the result of the the creation of the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor in 1953 and the success of the International Longshoremen's Association in the 1960s in organizing the workers.  He discusses the structure of the work day; the way in which jobs were distributed; the way men obtained jobs as longshoremen; and the way ships were unloaded.  He discusses the ways in which longshoremen kept busy on days when there was no work; DeMatteis' household chores on those days; and the ethnic demographics of the piers in New York, most of which were controlled by Italians.  He discusses attempts at unionization on the waterfront; workers who wished for stronger unions being labeled communists; and the success of the ILA in the 1960s."

This interview covers Vincenzo DeRosa's childhood in Italy; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1903; and his work as a longshoreman in Brooklyn, New York.  DeRosa begins by describing the beautiful landscapes of his hometown.  He recalls that he immigrated to the US in order to make a fortune and traveled with one of his cousins because he was too young to go by himself.  He settled in Brooklyn with his brother and other countrymen from Naples.  He describes the development of the longshoremen's union to which he belonged (likely the likely the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA)); the ethnic composition of the longshoremen; and the tension between Irish and Italian immigrants.  Other topics include a comparison between Brooklyn in the past and at the time of the interview; his children's occupations; his religious and political affiliations; his regret at never having returned to Italy; and his love for America."

The interview covers Moe Diamond's career as a garment worker and a member of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU).  Diamond discusses the history of the ILGWU, beginning with a strike of needleworkers in 1910 and the conditions that led to the strike; the conditions at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company that contributed to the high casualty rate in the fire in 1911; the ways in which conditions in factories changed after both of these events; and the ways in which Meyer London and Morris Hillquit helped to strengthen the ILGWU.  Other topics include garment factories in which Diamond worked and the workers in the factories; the importance of the Educational Alliance in Manhattan, New York to union members in the early 20th century; changes in the garment industry between the 1910s and the 1970s; and the changes in the Garment District neighborhood of Manhattan, New York."

The volume of the recording fluctuates throughout the interview, and background noise sometimes makes Duffy hard to hear.  Duffy recounts his parents' immigration to the US from Ireland in order to better themselves; that they were the first members of their family to immigrate; and that they aided the rest of their family in immigrating and finding work in New York.  He recalls working in an unspecified wallpaper factory and on tugboats and yachts, explaining that there were few if any strikes in either industry.  Other topics include his family's religious and political affiliations; his visits to vaudeville shows and Central Park during his leisure time; and a comparison of the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan in the past and at the time of the interview."

An unidentified man interjects comments throughout John Duffy's interview.  This interview covers Duffy's childhood in Ireland; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1929; and his life and work in the retail and transportation industries in New York, New York.  Duffy begins by describing his hometown of Dundalk, Ireland, emphasizing the town's position as a thriving railroad junction and its various industries including shoe and tobacco manufacturing (specifically P.J. Carroll \u0026 Company Limited).  He recalls the railroad being the major source of commerce and both his father and his grandfather working on the railroad.  He describes patterns of Irish immigration to the US, noting that many of the immigrants came from the western and southern towns in Ireland; that the Irish did not often immigrate as a family unit; the effects of religious and political conflicts on immigration; and the often contentious relationship between the Irish people and the English authorities."

He explains that he immigrated because he had a desire to travel and he recounts living with an uncle before moving to a boarding house on East 49th Street and 3rd Avenue in Manhattan.  He focuses on his work in the supply department at Bloomingdale's in Manhattan, emphasizing the mistreatment of workers in other departments in the store; the lack of job security; and the lack of stable promotion tracks for workers.  He explains that all of these factors contributed to the union organization of retail workers in the store, specifically through Local 65 of an unspecified retail workers' union (likely the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union).  He emphasizes the fragility of the early years of the union, describing tension among members when Bloomingdale's gave the workers a raise and had the union disperse the raises from a lump sum.  "

Other topics include religious, ethnic, and racial divisions in the workforce, particularly in the retail industry, and the negative relationship between Duffy's parish church and the Communist Party of the United States of America."

She discusses her involvement as a teenager in an anarchist movement in Kiev and the terrorist and syndicalist movements within it.  She describes her immigration to the US, including being delayed and having to travel back into eastern Europe due to illness; losing tickets and luggage due to the delays and backtracking; and traveling in first and third class.  She describes her first jobs in New York City, including pretending to know how to sew in order to secure a job and working as a finisher in a skirt factory.  In describing her union activity, she recounts attempting to organize the skirt factory and joining the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU).  She relates the early history of the ILGWU and mentions being a member of the Executive and Joint Boards of the ILGWU."

Topics of discussion include the availability and types of work for longshoremen; the hiring process and wages; and accidents on the waterfront.  Mario Cinisomo and Rosario Ferrentino discuss the different types of work done by longshoremen; the fact that each job had different levels of danger; that some jobs were dependent on the weather; and that all jobs were supervised differently by the foremen.  They recall that in the early 1920s, workers usually worked one or two days a week, increasing to three or four days a week before the Great Depression; that during the Great Depression employment opportunities were limited; that work was steady after the Great Depression; and, at the time of the interview, there was more stability in the field because of rules implemented by the ILA.  Cinisomo recalls standing on the corner of Columbia Street and President Street at five in the morning in an attempt to be hired each day, and going to each dock if he was not hired on the corner.  He explains that some workers were hired as a group rather than individually.  Ferrentino discusses occasionally working a full day but only getting paid for half and making 36 cents an hour.  Cinisomo and Ferrentino discuss workplace accidents, including winches falling out of gear and boxes falling on workers.  They discuss their belief that accidents were unavoidable in the industry and the fact that there was little or no injury compensation. "

Fields recalls his early life in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, including his father's employment with the Hamburg America Line; his memories of the 1918 flu epidemic; his employment by two of the major banks in Austria; and the effects of the 1929 stock market crash on his work in Vienna.  He discusses his immigration to the US, including his loneliness and seasickness during the voyage, and his belief that he would have died in the Nazi concentration camps had he not left Austria-Hungary.  Fields' first impressions of the US include feeling comfortable in New York, New York because he had seen it in movies; realizing that his immigrant status would prevent him from finding employment commensurate with his experience; and prioritizing finding a job and a place to live.

Fischetti discusses her early life in Sant'Angelo de Lombardi, Italy, including her family's vineyard and her courtship and marriage.  She discusses her husband's immigration to the US; his work as a peddler and construction worker in the US; and her life with his parents before her immigration in 1920.  She discusses joining the workforce after her children were grown and working in garment factories making sweaters, ladies' coats, and men's suits.  She discusses her husband's illness after she returned to work and his willingness to do housework while she was at work.  Other topics include her religion; her children; differences in South Brooklyn over the 50 years she lived there; and her volunteer work at CIAO."

Fox begins the interview by describing his childhood in Russia, focusing on anti-Semitism in his hometown, which included pogroms and abuse by the police.  He recounts not being paid during the three years of his tailoring apprenticeship and receiving meager pay for his long hours of work after his apprenticeship.  He recounts the Socialist Revolutionary Party meeting at his house and learning more about Socialism at the library until his library card was destroyed when it was learned that he was Jewish.  "

He describes his first job in a garment shop in New York City and explains that, in the beginning, he had to bring his own machine to work.  He notes that although he joined the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) Local 23 in order to fight for better wages, hours, and working conditions, change was slow due to factions within the union and corruption among the union leaders.  He recalls a strike that occurred in the early 1950s, through which workers acquired a twenty percent wage increase despite conflicts with strikebreakers brought in from Chicago, Illinois.  He discusses the ILGWU opening a school to train machine operators and the union becoming more inclusive, particularly in terms of the Italian population's involvement.  He explains that different skill levels and job types had different wage standards in the union and discusses working conditions in the garment shops.  He recounts that he established a ready-made garment store on Pitkin Avenue in Brooklyn with his brother and step-father, noting that the people paid to guard the store broke in and stole all the merchandise.

Fox discusses her life in Saint Kitts and Nevis, including being the youngest of seven children; her father working as a carpenter and being away from the family because of his work; and learning to read, write, and perform multiplication and division by the age of four.  She recalls beginning the process of becoming a teacher in the British West Indies at 15 years old, and becoming frustrated with her lack of advancement after teaching for over 20 years.  She mentions her immigration; the fact that she initially came to the US with no intention of staying permanently; and the fact that she was required to leave the country through Canada before she could become a citizen. She recounts living with her two older sisters in the US, and feeling that she was imposing because she was over 40 years old when she immigrated.  She discusses having trouble finding well paying work; receiving a certificate to be a pediatric nurses' aide; and studying early childhood education at Fordham University in the Bronx.  She discusses working for hospitals such as the Flowers Fifth Avenue Hospital in Valhalla, New York; St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan, New York; and Morrisania Hospital in the Bronx, New York."

The date of the interview is unknown.  This interview covers Corrado Frasca's childhood in Pollago Italy; his illegal immigration to the United States (US) in 1926; and his life and work as a longshoreman in Brooklyn.  Frasca begins this interview by describing his childhood in Pollago, Italy, recalling doing simple jobs for the local fishermen and seamen when he was eight years old.  He explains that he moved to Genoa when he was twelve and worked for several years aboard a passenger ship.  He discusses an uncle in New York encouraging him to come to the United States, and Frasca jumping ship in Norfolk, Virginia in 1926.  He describes traveling to Baltimore, Maryland to avoid the authorities and locals who spoke Italian coming to his aid by giving him room and board free of charge.  Frasca explains that his uncle brought him to Brooklyn where he began working as a longshoreman.  He describes shifting occupations depending on the seasons; working on ships going to South America in the winter; working as a longshoreman in Brooklyn during the rest of the year; and later establishing his own business as a peddler and fruit seller.  Frasca mentions joining a club established by immigrants from his hometown and the club providing social and fiscal support to its members during hard times.  He describes how he met his wife, an American citizen, through his uncle, who served as a matchmaker in their apartment building.  "

He describes the differences between his generation and his son's generation, noting his opinion that the younger generation is less social and less attached to traditional family values."

Main topics include Ophelia Fulwood's life in North Carolina, her migration north, her work as a maid, and her union activities. Fullwood recalls her early years in North Carolina including being raised by her mother's cousin; giving water to the workers on her grandfather's farm during the harvest season; leaving school in eighth grade to work as a maid; and learning about sex.  Some of her first impressions of New York, New York include being shocked by the segregation in the US; not having warm clothes; and being afraid to be alone in New York City.  She discusses her work as a maid, including her work schedule; the fact that she quit her job when her employers had marital problems; and that employment opportunities often came by word of mouth.  When discussing her feelings on being a maid, Fulwood mentioned preferring day labor over sleep-in positions; that she loved being able to control her own schedule at the time of the interview; and that she was firm during the hiring process about what type of work she would do and how much she should be paid for it."

The first interview was conducted by Rosenberg and Hirsch at an unknown location.  A man identified as John also contributes to the interview.  The second interview was conducted by Rosenberg at Jimmy Gavin's home in Brooklyn, New York.  The volume of the recording fluctuates throughout the interview.  This interview covers Gavin's childhood in Ireland; his involvement in the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War; his immigration to the United States (US); and his work as a boatswain and an organizer for both the International Seamen's Union of America (ISU) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).  Gavin begins by explaining that he does not believe that the working class knows its own history, providing a timeline of events that he considers important to the development of the working class. He describes his childhood in Ireland, recalling his attendance at an English national school; his love of the Gaelic language and Irish history and literature; fishing and hunting trips; and the contrast between his father, who was a Marxist and anti-religion, and his mother, a devout Catholic.  He describes joining the Irish Republican Army (IRA); leaving home at his father's behest in order to protect his family; not having a permanent home; learning how to use a gun; switching sides various times over the course of both the the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War; and returning briefly to his home after he was declared dead.

He describes his time working for the United States Coast Guard; the development of the ISU; his move to New York, New York; his contribution to organizing the Seamen's Unemployment Council in 1932; and various strikes for better conditions, particularly in terms of food quality and working hours.  Other topics include his opinions on politicians and journalists; his political views; his work dissuading strikebreakers from occupying positions that union workers had vacated while on strike; and his trips across the US to organize labor unions.

The majority of this interview, covering the first 25 years of Amelia Geiss' life, was not recorded.  Topics covered include Geiss' relationship with her husband; her experiences during the Great Depression; racial and ethnic tensions in her community in New York, New York; and her work at the Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center.  Geiss spends the majority of the interview discussing her relationship with her husband, Bill, including how he was separated from his first wife when they first began their relationship; the fact that his estranged wife stalked Geiss; and the fact that she moved multiple times to escape this harassment.  She discusses her husband's work as an electrician at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.  She recalls that they survived the Great Depression due to the fact that they both were able to work. She discusses the community she lived in at the time of the interview, including how ethnic discrimination had gotten worse over time, and that the community had more problems at the time of the interview because it was no longer predominantly German.  She discusses her volunteer work at the Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center, including the fact that she joined so that she and her husband would not fight after they retired; her fundraising efforts; both she and her husband being recognized by New York City for their work at the Center; and her participation on the Board of Directors."

She was apprenticed in an unspecified trade in Russia and worked in an unspecified industry in the United States (US).  She immigrated to the US with her sister and a friend in 1912, and the rest of her family immigrated the following year.  She initially stayed with an uncle in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and later lived in both Chicago, Illinois and New York, New York.  She attended an unspecified preparatory school in order to learn English.  She married and had three daughters.  Geller was an active Socialist and Anarchist and attended lectures, clubs, and meetings in order to learn more about radical political ideologies."

Geller describes her father's reluctance to let her attend school in Russia, explaining that he believed that she would never find a husband if she was educated.  She notes that the schools near her town were a privilege primarily for the children of the wealthy and not for Jewish children, but she recalls that her mother aided her in finding a tutor who instructed her in Russian, literature, and other subjects.  She recounts wanting to immigrate to the US because she wanted to become independent from her parents; broaden the scope of her studies; and avoid an arranged marriage.  She describes immigrating to the US with her sister and friend in 1912 and her mother convincing her father to sell his business and immigrate to the US with the rest of the family a year later. "

Gelo discusses her childhood in Tunis, including her education and her parents' backgrounds.  She provides a short history of the colonization of Tunisia and of the ethnic groups in Tunis.  She discusses her family's immigration to the US and the ethnic groups in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  She discusses her strict upbringing and rules her father imposed upon her; her courtship with her husband under these rules; and her younger sister's rebellion against the rules.  She discusses having to leave school in order to work to support her family and working as a finisher on men's clothes.  She describes the first factory in which she worked; the ethnic demographics of the workers, mainly Italian and Jewish, and the language barrier between the two groups; and her unhappiness in her work and her difficulty communicating with the Jewish workers.  She describes working conditions in the factories; her dissatisfaction with them; and her opinion that the workers were seriously mistreated.  "

The main topics discussed include Rose Godet's childhood in the Dominican Republic, her feelings about immigrating to the United States (US), her work experience, and her personal experiences in New York, New York.  Godet begins by discussing her early life in the Dominican Republic, including being of French descent; speaking multiple languages; and her father working for the Puccini Shipping Company.  Her early experiences in New York City include living on 140th Street in Manhattan; deciding to only live in Manhattan; disliking living in the US initially because she had never worked before; feeling lonely in the city; and finding the US to be substantially more expensive than the Dominican Republic.  Godet discusses her confusion regarding segregation, having never witnessed white flight before coming to the US.  She discusses her personal experiences during the Prohibition era and the Great Depression, including an Irish friend giving her bootleg liquor, though she did not like the taste; enjoying visiting speakeasies; and being employed pressing silk underwear.  She talks about World War II and her fear of air raid drills; that minimum wage requirements implemented by Franklin Roosevelt were not enforced; and her belief that the US government would pull men off the streets and force them into the military.  She notes her work experience, which included working as a saleswoman and interpreter for the Charles Broadway Rouss department store on Broadway in Manhattan and learning to type in order to work for a mail order company translating orders received in Spanish or French.  She discusses her employment at the National Biscuit Company packing cookies after she began to lose her eyesight, and feeling exploited by the company due to the minimal vacation time, long hours, and low wages."

She immigrated to the United States (US) and returned to Romania twice before settling permanently in the US.  Her first immigration to the US was in 1907 with her father and younger brother, who died in the Netherlands during their travels.  Goldman and her father settled in New York, New York, where her father worked as an umbrella maker and she worked in a blouse factory.  They returned to Romania after six months in the US.  Goldman returned to the US in 1910 with a cousin and worked refurbishing old umbrellas.  She saved enough money to buy passage for her parents and five siblings though they declined to travel.  She returned to Romania in 1912 and resumed her education.  After leaving school, she worked in a foreign language bookstore and for the American Red Cross in Bucharest.  She returned to the US in 1920.  She worked in a bank before meeting her husband, who was a pharmacist and owned a pharmacy.  She worked in the pharmacy until the birth of their daughter.  After the death of her husband, she worked for the Jewish Labor Committee in Manhattan."

Goldman discusses her multiple immigrations to the US between 1907 and 1920 and her reasons for returning to Romania before permanently settling in the US in 1920.  She discusses the pogrom that led to her initial immigration with her father and one of her brothers in 1907; the death of her brother during their travels; and her father's decision to return to Romania after six months in US.  She discusses her father's work as an umbrella maker and his decision to send her to work rather than school, in order to save money for their return to Romania. She describes her unhappiness at having to leave the US as she felt it had a more egalitarian society than Romania.  She recalls her decision to return to the US in 1910 and forego her education in order to work and save money to send to her family in Romania.  She describes her work refurbishing old umbrellas and recalls her decision to return to Romania when her family decided not to immigrate to the US.  "

They discuss their early lives in Gorlice, including the differences in their educations and the living arrangements of their family.  They discuss the differences between religious and secular schools, including the curricula; the fact that only the most religious boys attended the religious schools; and games they would play during recess.  Goldman and Shapiro describe Gorlice; the fact that Jews lived among other religious groups in the town; the relationship between the two groups, including anti-Semitism; the social hierarchy amongst the Jewish residents; and the layout and architecture of the town.  They discuss their religious upbringing, in particular the separation between men and women and the fact that women were not required to attend religious services.  "

Goren discusses his early life in David-Gorodok, including his education and his participation in a local smuggling operation.  He describes David-Gorodok, including the fact that Jews lived among other religious groups in town; the fact that anti-Semitism was common; the social hierarchy amongst the Jewish residents; political instability, due to control of the town being passed between different Russian gangs; and the participation of the residents in the Zionist movement and the General Jewish Labour Bund of Lithuania, Poland and Russia.  He describes his immigration to the US and the fact that it coincided with a general emigration of Jews from his town.  He discusses his family's assimilation in the US and their desire to leave behind all associations from the old world."

He states that after the World War II, the racial and ethnic demographics of the industry changed from being predominantly Eastern European Jews to include more African American, Greek, and Puerto Rican employees.  He describes the atmosphere in the factories and the relationship of the different ethnic and racial groups as amicable.  He describes the conditions in the factories as poor but notes that he did not mind since he was happy simply to be in the US.  He discusses the role of labor unions in the fur industry, including his membership in the International Fur and Leather Workers Union of the United States and Canada; his participation in strikes; attacks on strikebreakers by union members; and general violence during the strikes.

The location is likely the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) Union Hall on Court Street in Brooklyn, New York.

Granato recalls being a member of the Italian Navy from 1914 to 1919; immigrating to the United States (US) and settling in Omaha, Nebraska in 1920; and working in Nebraska for four years before returning to Sicily.  He discusses marrying his wife during his return to Italy; remaining in Sicily for less than a year before returning to the US; and having three children.  He describes his work as a longshoreman; joining the ILA in 1925; working in Hoboken, New Jersey and Staten Island, New York, as well as many piers in New York City; moving bags of sugar and cement for transport to the Panama Canal; standing on Columbia Street in Brooklyn in an attempt to find work; and making approximately 60 cents an hour.

He recounts not encountering much racial discrimination in the northern US but attributes this to the fact that he was poor and did not have occasion to go to places that were likely to be segregated.  He explains that he would generally stay in areas with a majority black population and not put himself in a position in which he was likely to face discrimination and prejudice, although he does recount two incidents of discrimination he faced in New York.  He discusses jobs he had as a building superintendent in Manhattan, including his responsibilities; the types of people for whom he worked; and issues he had at the buildings regarding an unspecified building workers union.  He explains his decision to leave his work as a superintendent because of an illness and his desire to have a job with regular hours, which he found at Montefiore Hospital.  "

Green begins by recalling his early life in Georgia, including having six brothers and six sisters; loving to play baseball with his brothers; attending school until the age of 12; working on the family cotton farm; becoming adept at catching squirrels; and his father serving as a deacon at the local church.  He discusses his memories of World War I, including seven young men from his neighborhood being killed in active duty; his hope that he would avoid being drafted because he was recently married and working on a farm, which was considered an essential job; and his conscription in 1918. He elaborates on his military service, including not being discharged on schedule because of an illness; being posted on a rifle range; and being disappointed that he was not deployed to France to fight.

The date is unknown.  This interview covers Greenfield's childhood in Hungary; her immigration to the United States (US) in the 1920s; and her life and work in the garment industry in New York, New York.  Greenfield begins the interview by discussing her love of the US, emphasizing the importance of freedom and economic opportunities.  She explains that the population of Hungary was split between the poor and the rich; that the poor could not afford to send their children to school; and that one could not marry outside of her class.  She recounts her father's conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army and capture by Russian forces in 1914; his six years as a prisoner of war; and her mother's decision to disperse her children to the care of her sisters in order to keep them safe.  She recalls her move to the Czecho-Slovak region of Austria-Hungary during the course of World War I.  She focuses on the opportunities afforded to the Jewish population there, citing her sisters' educations; free disability and sick leave benefits for workers; and Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk's policies that provided food and education for the young.  She explains that she wanted to immigrate to the US in order to attend school and aid her family but notes that her father disapproved because he believed she would lose her religion if she went. "

She explains that she originally lived with her cousins in Sunbury, Pennsylvania but moved to live with a friend on East 10th Street in Manhattan.  She describes her awe upon first observing the amount of people living in New York City and a strike that occurred the day she arrived.  She explains that she worked predominantly in the garment industry, recalling that she was not paid at her first job on 38th Street and Broadway in order to learn the trade.  She recounts her supervisor at a dress house at 1400 Broadway giving her six months' paid vacation in order to visit her family in Hungary.  She recalls joining an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union) and acquiring better wages and hours.  She describes earning enough money that she was able to pay her cousin back for the cost of the fare to the US and even help send her brother to university in Czechoslovakia, emphasizing the fact that she always kept her family in mind.  Other topics include the role Greenfield's parents played in developing her spirituality; her trips back to Hungary; the fate of family members that remained in Hungary during World War II; the friends she made in New York City; a comparison of Jewish children's behaviors with the behaviors of children from other religious groups; and her view regarding the refusal of many young people to go to war (presumably with Vietnam) at the time of the interview."

The main topics of this interview include Harris' childhood in Jamaica; his work at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, New York; his union activity; and his political ideologies.  Harris discusses his childhood in Jamaica, including not having any siblings; his mother living in Panama; his father dying when Harris was seven years old; and his aunt and cousin raising him.  He recalls his different jobs in Jamaica, which included farm worker, bank clerk, cook, and employee of the US Consulate in Jamaica.  He discusses his early experiences at Montefiore Hospital, including living in the hospital dormitories for two years; beginning his employment in the dietary unit delivering food to patients in a tuberculosis ward; not planning on staying at Montefiore for an extended period of time; and eventually  feeling obligated to stay due to his loyalty to both the patients and his co-workers.

Heltzer begins the interview by describing her childhood in Kiev, noting that conversations regarding politics were forbidden in school; that she acquired her Socialist viewpoints from family and friends; and that she attended secret Socialist meetings.  She recalls that her mother paid for her to be a live-in apprentice to a furrier in Kiev because her sister noted the high-paying opportunities in that industry in the US.  She describes her mother sending Heltzer's oldest sister to the US in the hopes that she would eventually be able to send for the rest of the family.  She explains that her brother was sent to Siberia due to his revolutionary activity and that their mother sent him to the United States in order to prevent his being arrested again.  She notes that she immigrated soon after him in 1906, with their two remaining sisters following her.  "

She describes the staff in the different houses in which she worked, including the responsibilities of each staff member; the types of people that were successful in domestic service; and advice she received from co-workers.  She compares the behavior of different ethnic groups in domestic service and her disapproval of the Irish workers, who would swear  while on duty and play cards late at night.  She describes the food that was provided for the staff at different houses in which she worked, including one in which the staff was provided only with leftovers until Henning complained.  She recounts being repeatedly subjected to sexual harassment by male employers and warning the men that she would quit if the behavior continued.  She describes the experiences of her sister and other women who were sexually harassed and assaulted while in domestic service and their fear of losing their jobs if they reported these incidents.

The interview covers Anna Herzog's life in Minsk, Russia, her immigration to the United States (US), her involvement in union activities and strikes, and her personal life. Herzog recollects her early life in Minsk, including her father dying when she was three years old; her brother serving as a father figure; Jewish children not being allowed to attend school; wanting to play instead of work; and working for a year in a garment factory on a pedal sewing machine.  Her first memories of New York, New York include learning English through friends, and being overwhelmed with the size of New York City.  She remembers needing to supply her own sewing machine at her first job; and requiring assistance carrying the sewing machine up and down the stairs.  She recalls the differences between garment work in Russia and the United States.  She recalls a strike in 1911, during which the workers went on strike for 15 days in order to achieve better pay, better working conditions, and for owner-supplied sewing machines.  Herzog's discussion of her personal life includes meeting her husband and their wedding in Toronto, Canada; having two sons and adopting her sister's daughter; discontinuing work because she was pregnant; and moving to the Workmen's Circle Home against her son's wishes."

Herzog discusses his life in Galicia, including working as a tinsmith with his father; belonging to an unspecified metalworkers' union; and his father warning him not to join the Army.  He recalls learning English in the US through a librarian who would give him books in both Yiddish and English; and attending night school.  He discusses leisure activities in which he participated, including going with his children to the park, beach, and baseball games in Brooklyn, New York; having season tickets to the Metropolitan Opera for 35 years; and enjoying attending symphony concerts.  Herzog recalls knowing very little about politics upon his arrival to the US; quickly coming to dislike the Republican Party because they represented the rich; and being a member of the Socialist Party of America for most of his life.  He discusses his involvement with an unspecified building trades union; his election as a trustee for his New York local; his service on the examining board; and his belief that every worker should be a member of a union."

This interview covers Higgins' childhood in Ireland; work experiences in New York, New York; social activities in the Irish community of New York; and his union involvement.  Higgins discusses his early life in Ireland, including having a happy childhood; his family owning a small grocery store in New Ross; attending a Christian Brothers school; horseback riding and swimming in a local river before work; working as an accountant for an import/export company in County Wexford; and emigrating from Ireland because he was curious and wanted adventure.  He discusses his early experiences in New York, including having no friends or family nearby and living in a community that included Hungarians, Irish, and Germans.  His early work experience includes being employed by the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company until he quit because his pay was less than the other employees'.  Higgins discusses stealing a hammer, chisel, and wrench in order to work as a mechanic at a shipyard; working as a carpenter in order to make money while on strike at the shipyard; and making good money at the shipyard because he was willing to work long hours and overtime.  He recollects being the chief engineer for multiple hotels, including the St. Andrews Hotel in Manhattan for over 22 years; never having problems finding work because other Irish immigrants would always help him; and belonging to the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 30.  He recalls drinking at the pub with his friends; having negative feelings about Prohibition; watching Irish football and hurling on Long Island on Sundays; and being a member and secretary of the County Wexford Organization, which met on 59th Street in Manhattan."

Higgins discusses her childhood in Ireland in great detail, including the lives of her eight siblings; inheritance laws and her father's disinheritance due to his choice of wife; and Higgins' family home in New Ross.  Higgins remembers class distinctions within her community; the education system in Ireland; and her opinion that her life would have been boring had she attended college.

She discusses the 1916 Easter Rising and its aftermath, including her brother-in-law's wrongful incarceration for weapons possession; the hunger strike and eventual death of Terence MacSwiney; and the fact that her family supported the revolution but believed that it occurred too late. She discusses her work with the United States Army Quartermaster Corps in France after WWI, designing cemeteries for the reburial of American soldiers, and organizing a chapter of American Gold Star Mothers.  She explains that she immigrated to the United States (US) and settled in New York, New York in 1933 because it was the only place she could find work.  Her first impressions of the US include her surprise at the bigotry towards the Irish and her amazement at the poor education of American men. Higgins discusses her work as a lady's companion, including attending the film premiere of \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eGone with the Wind\u003c/span\u003e; visiting some of the Nordic countries, the Baltics, and the Soviet Union; and enjoying the fact that her employer owned a car.

The main topics discussed include Simon Hoffman's life in Russia; his immigration to the United States (US) and his early days there; his work in New York, New York; and leisure activities in which he participated.  Hoffman discusses his early life in Russia, including the fact that he learned four languages despite not attending school; his work selling sewing notions; and the fact that the Jewish community mixed with other local ethnic groups for commerce but were otherwise segregated.  He recalls his family, including the fact that his father was a butcher and was substantially older than his mother; that his mother regretted marrying an older man; his mother's work manufacturing wigs and hairpieces; and his three siblings.  He discusses his immigration to the US, including paying a smuggler 25 rubles to help him cross the border between Russia and Germany; sailing on the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eSS Bremen\u003c/span\u003e from Bremen, Germany; being assisted by the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society after his arrival at Ellis Island, New York; and residing with his step-siblings in the Bronx for a short time before finding work.  Hoffman recalls his employment in the US, including making hats on Houston Street in Manhattan; receiving a pay increase during World War I; being employed by the City of New York to clean public parks during the Depression; and resuming his employment in the cap making industry in 1942.  He mentions joining an unspecified cap makers' union (likely United Hatters of North America) in 1915, and was proud of the fact that he maintained his union membership after his retirement.  Hoffman discusses his leisure activities, including reading the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eNew York Times\u003c/span\u003e, the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eJewish Daily Forward\u003c/span\u003e, and the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eJewish Morning Journal\u003c/span\u003e; visiting the Hayden Planetarium at the Museum of Natural History in Manhattan; and attending the Jewish theater frequently."

He discusses the immigration process at Ellis Island, New York, including a required medical examination; the requirement of either $25 or someone to vouch for you; and immigration societies that would vouch for individuals who knew no one in New York and assist them with acquiring lodgings.  His first impressions of New York City include not feeling excited about living in New York; the abundance of poverty; and hostilities between ethnic groups, especially between the Jewish and Irish communities.  He discusses his involvement with Socialism and the Socialist Party of America, including attending lectures and meetings at the Rand School of Social Science in Manhattan; his feelings about Social Security; society's lack of appreciation for social programs at the time of the interview; and reading the Socialist newspaper \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eThe New York Call\u003c/span\u003e.   Hoffzimmer discusses his family, including meeting his wife through friends; and sending his daughter to the Workmen's Circle to learn about Jewish language and culture.  He discusses his great appreciation for his wife; and the accomplishments of his grandson. He recalls his work experience, in particular finding employment as a hatter through his work manufacturing human hair goods. He describes traveling to the western US and to Mexico with the money he saved at his first job.  He recounts learning Spanish and opening a business selling portraits while in Mexico; and opening his own hattery upon his return to New York with the money he made.  He also recalls not requiring government assistance during the Great Depression because of his business; discusses the benefits and drawbacks of modernization; and discusses his membership in the United Hatters of North America."

This compilation may have been created for a radio broadcast, but it is unclear if it was ever broadcasted.  The volume and sound quality of the recording fluctuate between excerpts.  The recording begins with an introduction to the project by Scott Weir, and an unidentified female interviewer explains that the recording addresses the experiences of three groups:  Eastern European Jews; Italians; and African-American migrants from the southern United States (US).  She notes that the excerpts reference the experiences of these groups in New York, New York; in factories; and in the formation of unions.  She describes the social, economic, and political conditions that prompted many Eastern European Jews to immigrate to the US and interview excerpts follow discussing anti-Semitism, religious traditions, and education.  Weir gives a brief history of Italian immigration to the US, and interview excerpts that follow discuss the economic contrast between landowners and agricultural laborers in Italy, and the fact that many Italians expected to return to Italy once they had enough money.  The last section of the recording contains interview excerpts discussing the history of African Americans from Reconstruction to the 1970s; racial discrimination; the sequence of family migration; and ethnic relations among people in different New York City neighborhoods."

The family lived in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.  Ippolito attended school through the eighth grade.  He worked in a bed factory in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn for a few years before getting a job in a furniture factory.  He spent the bulk of his career in the furniture industry.  He was a member of the United Furniture Workers of America (UFWA) Local 76 and was a shop steward in different factories between 1937-1965.  He was a member of unspecified joint and executive boards and a trustee (the latter two likely UFWA Local 76).  He married Stephanie Ippolito in 1936, with whom he had two sons.  In 1962, the family moved from Williamsburg to the Ridgewood neighborhood of Queens."

Ippolito's wife, Stephanie, participates in the interview.  The interview covers Ippolito's immigration to the United States (US), his family, his working life, his union activity, his social activities, and his political affiliation.  Ippolito discusses his family's staggered immigration to the US; his father's immigration seven years before the rest of the family; and his father's work to bring the rest of the family to the US.  He discusses leaving school to join the workforce; working in a bed factory and being told he was too young for that type of work; and finding a job in the furniture industry through a friend.  He recounts joining the United Furniture Workers of America Local 76; participating in strikes; and losing a job as a result of one of the strikes.  He recounts working in a factory producing radio and television cabinets; switching to war production during World War II and making uniforms for the United States Army; and returning to production of television and radio cabinets after the war.  He lists furniture plants in which he worked; the dates of his employment; and the types of furniture each produced.  Ippolito and his wife describe the changes in the ethnic composition of the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn between the early 20th century and in the 1960s when they decided to move to Ridgewood.  He lists social clubs to which belonged, including the Happy Hearts, and discusses support provided to the poor by the Democratic Party."

He recalls that he was fearful as a child as a result of his sheltered upbringing.  He describes his father's work as a leather cutter in handbag factories; a summer he worked with his father in one of these factories when he was 16 years old; the difference in pay between skilled and unskilled laborers; and racial discrimination amongst the workers.  He describes his time at the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan; how inclusive an environment it was; and how it matured him.  He discusses his decision to drop out of the City College of New York and jobs he held subsequent to that decision.  "

The date and interviewer are unknown.  The main topics of discussion include Johns' early childhood and a comparison of New York when he migrated and at the time of the interview.  Johns discusses his childhood in the southern United States (US), including his siblings and the death of their father in 1928.  Johns recalls growing up on a farm that produced cotton, tobacco, corn, vegetables, and raised animals; and moving to New York in 1930 to find work during the Great Depression.  His earliest memories of New York City include believing the apartment buildings were factories because he had never seen such tall buildings; joining the Shiloh Baptist Church in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan shortly after his migration; joining a Masonic Lodge in 1948; and paying six dollars to an agency to find him a job.  He compares New York City when he arrived and at the time of the interview, including increased crime rates; the changing use of a particular racial epithet; his opinion that children were not as well behaved as they once were; his belief that making less money made people less greedy; and that the younger generation does not know how to dance."

The main topics in this interview include Callie Johnson's childhood in North Carolina, her work as a teacher and a tutor, her romantic endeavors, and her social life.  Johnson begins by discussing her early life in North Carolina, including her multiple siblings, their lives, and occupations; the death of her mother; her father's work as a minister; and her responsibility for her six younger brothers.  She discusses attending the Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina in order to become a teacher; desiring to work as a teacher in Africa; and having to leave teaching because she became ill. She recalls her seven year engagement to a man she met in college; his refusal to marry before he completed his degree; and his death before their wedding."

She recalls her social life, including associating herself with mostly young professionals in New York; marrying because she was getting older; and not having a happy marriage because she realized her husband had married her for her money and property.  She discusses owning a boardinghouse for young working women; helping these women to support themselves; allowing the women to stay for one month free of charge and then charging them minimal amounts until they could afford their own room elsewhere; and deciding to create the house because she would have wanted help if she was in the same situation."

Joseph discusses living on 62nd street in Manhattan, New York with her mother from the time they immigrated to the United States (US) until Joseph married, and giving her mother all of her wages.  She recalls taking the N train in the New York City subway to the Garment District neighborhood of Manhattan in order to look for work; sewing buttons by hand in a garment factory; and never feeling that she was denied work because of her race.  She discusses her husband, including the fact that they met at his uncle's church; her confusion regarding his place of birth in the Caribbean; his work in the garment industry; their two children, both of whom died in infancy; and his death in 1953."

The main topics of this interview include Joseph Katz's childhood in Lithuania, his work in the garment industry, his education in the United States (US), and his union involvement.  Katz begins by discussing his early life in Lithuania, including having two brothers who became Hebrew teachers; living in a two room house which doubled as a small grocery store; and immigrating to the US in order to avoid the draft in Lithuania.  He describes his life after immigration, including arriving in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but immediately moving to Baltimore, Maryland to stay with a family friend; attending night school in Baltimore to learn English; training to be a cutter in the garment industry and being paid five dollars a week; joining the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union (ACWA) Local 15 in Baltimore; and moving to New York City  in order to find work when his Local went on strike.  Katz discusses his employment after migrating to New York, including transferring to the ACWA Local 4; being paid double what he received in Baltimore; attending an unspecified design school at night; and working seasonally.  He discusses his union involvement in detail, including his attendance at weekly meetings; his participation in votes regarding strikes; the lack of strength of the union in regards to negotiation with businesses; and the fact that the ACWA provided educational programs for its members."

The interview covers Rose Kriemer's family and childhood in Russia, her immigration to the United States (US), her working life, and her union activity.  Kriemer discusses her family and childhood in Russia, including her father's occupation as a teacher in Kiev and the family's small farm.  She describes working in the US after her immigration and wanting to attend school, but being unable to do so as she was required to work overtime in order to keep her job.  She recounts returning to work in order to provide better opportunities for her children.  She describes the first factory in which she worked, including the decent working conditions; her salary; one strike in which she participated that brought in an unspecified fur workers' union (likely the International Fur and Leather Workers Union of the United States and Canada); changes in working conditions and salaries after the factory was unionized; and her return to the factory after her children started school.  She describes herself as a fast worker and able to make a good living with piece work.  She describes the abilities of the other workers in relation to herself; the types of jobs in the factory; and the division of labor between men and women.  She discusses the system of work in the factory; the fact that some workers brought work home in order to make more money through the piece work system; and her decision to bring this to the notice of the supervisors.  She describes seasonal work, including working overtime from January to April and working two or three days a week the rest of the year.   She explains that most problems in the factory existed between the workers since the unions taught the members how to get along with management."

The interview covers Rose Lapidus' early life in Russia and her working life.  Lapidus discusses her early life in a small town near Minsk, Russia, including antisemitism there and different jobs she held as a child and young woman.  She discusses her immigration to the United States (US).  She describes her first few jobs in garment factories in the US and the reasons she lost them, attributing these losses to the fact that the factories were non-union.  She recounts working after her marriage and up until a few weeks before the birth of her son.  She discusses not working in one place for too long; finding jobs through friends or agencies; preferring to be paid a salary rather than for piecework; and taking in work at home while her son was young.  She describes the physical conditions in union and non-union factories and the benefits to working in union factories.

The interview covers Catherine Leddie's early life in Ireland, her immigration to the United States (US), her working life, and her personal life.  Leddie recalls Ireland as a beautiful place in which everyone had plenty to eat, but that young people were eager to leave as there was no opportunity for them there.  She recalls enjoying the voyage to the US with neighbors and friends and knowing what to expect in New York, New York from listening to other immigrants who returned to Ireland recount their experiences.  Her memories of her working life in New York include searching advertisements for housework, as that was the only work available to Irish women.  She describes her first job living and working in the house of Henry Siegel in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan; being happy to work for the family; and enjoying their displays of wealth, especially their horses, carriages, and large household staff.  She discusses how, as she gained more experience, she was able to acquire better paying positions.  "

Main topics include Kelson Lee's work as a milliner; his life in New York, New York from the Prohibition era through World War II; and social activities in which he participated.  Lee touches on his early life, including being the oldest of six children; having one sister who was a doctor; and his family spreading out around the United States while he stayed in New York.  He discusses his work as a milliner, including starting by selling flowers to hat manufacturers before owning his own company  manufacturing ladies' hats.  He recalls his hiring practices, including the fact that most of his workers were women; that he would not hire immigrants, in particular German Jews; and that he and his employees were members of the United Hatters of North America.  He explains that his company survived the Great Depression because women did not stop wearing hats during the period. He comments on his social activities, including frequenting speakeasies, nightclubs, and cafes; and reading the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eNew York Times\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eNew York Post\u003c/span\u003e, and \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eNew York Herald Tribune\u003c/span\u003e.  He also discusses his wife, including meeting her at a restaurant that he and his friends went to regularly; attending many social activities and events with her; never fighting in their 40 years of marriage; and missing her tremendously after she died."

He recalls many individuals resorting to selling apples on street corners during the Depression; the crowds in the streets when the World War I armistice was signed; and his opinion that World War I was much more difficult to survive than World War II.

Main topics discussed include John Leonard's family and childhood; his work experience; and his participation in World War I (WWI), his leisure activities; and his politics.  Leonard discusses his family, including his parents' emigration from Ireland; his father's employment with the New York City Department of Street Cleaning; his six siblings; the death of his parents; and his lack of emotional support after the death of his mother in 1915.  He recalls his childhood, including living in different areas of Manhattan; attending both Catholic and public elementary schools; and living in a predominantly German and Irish community. He discusses his employment history, including working for the Siegel-Cooper department store in Manhattan as a messenger during school vacations; working for Jacob Ruppert \u0026 Company brewery in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan; and being employed in an unspecified war production factory during World War II.  He discusses working in construction for most of his life and his wife supplementing his income by working from home as a seamstress. He recalls his  military service during WWI, including being drafted into the Army; being sent to Camp Upton on Long Island for training; and being stationed at Camp Upton for a short time before the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.  Other topics regarding WWI include the increased beer tax preventing Leonard from frequenting bars for lunch; his neighbors not supporting  the United States' (US) involvement in the war until the sinking of the \u003cspan class=\"ead-emph ead-emph-italic\"\u003eRMS Lusitania\u003c/span\u003e; and that after the war there were no jobs.

Topics include Goldie Leos' childhood in Russia; her education; her immigration to the United States (US) and first experiences in New York, New York; her marriage; her work experiences; and her views on religion.  Leos discusses her childhood in Russia, including the fact that her family ran a business selling animal hides; that her father was a scholar while her mother controlled the household and business; and that she supported the family after her mother died by selling homemade candy to local businesses.  She recalls her father remarrying; disliking her stepmother; the family moving to Baranovichi, Russia from Lychkovtse, Russia after her father remarried; and resenting having to continue supporting the family after they relocated.  She discusses her education, including being one of only eight Jewish girls in Lychkovtse to learn Hebrew;  learning Yiddish and Russian; receiving private tutoring because there was no public education for Jews; and feeling frustrated that she was not taught skills she could use in the workforce."

The interview covers Samuel Levine's childhood in Brestowitz, Poland; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1913; and his work in the garment and service industries and as a peddler.  Levine describes his childhood in Poland, recalling the various garment factories in which he worked from the age of 13.  He notes that he decided to immigrate to the US in order to avoid conscription into the Russian Army.  He explains that he first lived with his uncle in Portchester, New York before moving to Cherry Street in Manhattan.  He emphasizes the strong relationship between himself and his wife's family that developed over the years in which he boarded with them and after his marriage in 1916.  He describes working as a milliner, peddler, waiter, and cloakman, noting that although he initially made less money in the US than he did in Poland, the work in the US was easier.  Other topics include his education at night classes in New York; his wife's occupation as a trimmer; his enjoyment of the movies and Jewish theater; his US citizenship; and his children's education."

Levinson discusses his difficulty emigrating from the Soviet Union, including leaving his mother and sister behind to walk to the border of the Soviet Union and Poland; having to bribe Bolshevik border guards with his mother's watch; sending for his mother and sister after he arrived in Poland; and his mother being shot by the Bolshevik guards.  He recalls his family being arrested in Poland for being in the country illegally; receiving valid passports with the help of the Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society of America; and the anti-Semitism the family encountered in Poland.  He recalls his early experiences in the United States (US) including working in a dry goods store; quitting his job in order to attend a private school; his father having a stroke, leaving Levinson the sole earner of the household; and finding a job in the knitting industry."

He recalls being elected to a provisional committee at his first ILGWU meeting and increasing the number of knitting workers in attendance by asking everyone to bring a new attendee to each meeting.  He discusses his political involvement within his local including being a member of the executive board; holding nearly every office and being a member of every committee; being elected as the business agent in 1943; being re-elected in every election until he retired in 1972; and feeling extremely proud that he was able to influence the knitting industry through his work in the ILGWU."

This interview covers George Lewis's childhood in Alabama; his migrations to Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New York; and his life and work at each of these locations.  Lewis begins by discussing a lack of education in the United States (US), noting that many schools excluded black children and poor children.  He recalls having a doctor create a fake birth certificate and a friend teach him the appropriate technical knowledge so that he could work on the railroad.  He describes a series of migrations after he left the railroad, noting that he went from the southern US to the northern US and back again before realizing that he could no longer tolerate the racism in his hometown and leaving for good in 1920.  Lewis describes migrating to New York, New York in 1922, recalling that he did not have any family in New York and that he had to pursue different lines of work because employers were wary of hiring black employees in the mechanical fields.  Other topics include descriptions of his jobs and wages; the impact of segregation on the various places in which he lived and traveled; his leisure activities in New York; anecdotes about how he developed his skills; his recollections concerning labor unions; and his experiences with politics and religion."

Loskowitz compares his life in Russia with his life in US, including his surprise at the differences in the family's living arrangements; his confusion over laundry hanging outdoors on clotheslines; and his experiences at school.  He discusses his work at the Canadian Car and Foundry Company's munitions plant in New Jersey; the explosion at the plant in 1917; and his recuperation at a stranger's home.  "

He describes his wife changing her and their children's last name to Laskoe in order to Americanize it and his neutral feelings about this change.

This interview covers Gwendaline Lynch's childhood and early adult life in Jamaica and Colombia; her immigration to the United States (US) in 1921; and her work for and relationship with Marcus Garvey.  Lynch describes her childhood and education in Jamaica.  She discusses her immigration to Colombia after graduating from St. John's College and Preparatory School and her decision to live near her step-sister and her husband.  She describes her work as a secretary for a prestigious banker and how his competitors tried to poach her while he was away.  She explains that she did not encounter racial prejudice in Colombia, but that there were distinctions along gender and class lines and that she was viewed as different because it was not customary for women to work.  She explains that she returned to Jamaica when she contracted malaria and from there immigrated to the United States (US) in 1921, originally intending to stay only six months."

She describes living with her aunt on 7th Avenue and West 142nd Street in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York and meeting her first Jamaican friend at St. Philip's Church in Harlem.  She explains that she first met Marcus Garvey in Jamaica and that she became his secretary and stenographer in New York after attending one of his meetings there.  She describes Garvey's ideology and philosophy; the problems with developing and implementing the Black Star Line, particularly the first voyage of the Yarmouth; tension between Garvey's idealist views and the mercenary tendencies of those that worked for him; his relationship with W.E.B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington; and his arrest for mail fraud, trial, and subsequent time in jail.  She explains that she left Garvey's organization before she married in 1925.  She discusses her career after her marriage, including working for a broker in Harlem, for a dress business, and for the federal government during World War II.  Other topics include teaching English to children in Colombia; political disputes and the impact they had on the Colombian people; a secretarial business she established with some friends in New York; her children's education and occupations; and a comparison of the situation of the black population in the US in the past and at the time of the interview."

The interview covers Magliacano's early life in Salerno, Italy; his immigration to the United States (US); his varied career in the American labor movement; and his personal life.  Magliacano discusses his childhood in San Marco in the province of Salerno; his family; and his immigration to the US.  He discusses working as a barber in New York City; being a member of an unspecified barbers' union; attending an unspecified school in Manhattan (likely the Rand School of Social Science); and attending and graduating from an unspecified chiropractic college in Manhattan (likely the Carver Chiropractic College)  He discusses hitchhiking to Chicago, Illinois after graduation to attend a postgraduate course at an unspecified chiropractic college there; learning that the barbers' union was holding its national convention in Indianapolis, Indiana and deciding to attend; and deciding to rejoin the labor movement while at the convention.  He discusses joining the Italian American anti-Fascist movement in New York and this decision leading to his becoming an organizer for different labor unions, including the United Textile Workers of America (UTW) and the United Shoe Workers' Union (USWU).  He discusses his work as an organizer; his involvement as a representative of the UTW in the textile workers' strike in Passaic, New Jersey in 1926; his work with an unspecified relief organization aiding striking coal miners in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky in 1928 and 1929; and his work for the USWU between 1929 and 1932.  Other topics include Magliacano's opinion of the Catholic Church; his travel to the Soviet Union in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a member of a trade union delegation; a visit to San Marco in 1961 and the changes there since his childhood; and his life at the time of the interview."

She describes dreaming about living in the US, noting the freedom of speech and greater economic opportunity as her main reasons for wanting to migrate.  She explains that her husband had been a teacher in Puerto Rico but worked as a clerk at the Metropolitan Hospital in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York after their migration.  She recounts her family's Americanization, noting that although they retained some of the culinary traditions of Puerto Rico, they changed the majority of their customs, in particular their language.  She explains that the neighborhoods surrounding both 110th Street and 103rd Street were bad, recalling gang and drug activity, but notes that neither of these issues prevented her children from thriving.  She describes city funded programs and Catholic charities that would take the children on trips and leisure activities at beaches, parks, and the movies.  She recounts instances of discrimination against her and her children and the relationships among different ethnic groups in the neighborhoods in which she lived."

The interview covers Mansberg's early life in Galicia, Austria-Hungary; her separation from her family during World War I; her life in Europe after the war; her immigration to the United States (US); and her life in New York City up to the 1930s.  Topics from her early life include her family's poverty; her difficult relationship with her stepmother; her affection for her father and her sorrow when he was unable to earn enough wages to support the family; and her education.  Mansberg's memories of World War I include fleeing from Cossacks with her family; running away on her own to present-day Czechoslovakia, where she worked on a farm; and her reunion with her family after the war.  She recounts meeting her future husband, Morris Mansberg, and moving with him to Budapest; learning about communism; and her decision to emigrate from Austria-Hungary in 1921 after Miklós Horthy came to power.

The interview covers Fannie Marin's early life in Poland; her two marriages and the birth of her son; and her working life in the United States (US).  She discusses her immigration to the US in 1906 and having to leave her son in Poland with her in-laws until she was able to send for him in 1910.  She discusses her first jobs in the US, including sewing ribbons on pajamas in a factory and working as a practical nurse in a doctor's office.  She discusses her second husband, who was a painter and a member of an unspecified painters' union (possibly the Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators, and Paperhangers of America), and his death in 1923 due to lead poisoning.  She discusses her job as a fur finisher in her brother-in-law's shop and the different ethnic groups in the shop.  She discusses her membership in an unspecified fur workers' union (likely the International Fur Workers Union of the United States and Canada) and political struggles within the union, particularly between supporters of Benjamin Gold and supporters of Morris Kaufman."

Massa recalls a rough upbringing in Italy, including making less than 50 Lire in a good week; being punished physically by his mother if he didn't behave; gaining longshoreman experience working on a boat; and coming to the United States in order to have a better life.  He discussed injuries he sustained while working as a longshoreman, including falling down a flight of stairs and injuring his back, and receiving $600 in compensation for the loss of part of his finger.  He briefly mentions his involvement with the International Longshoremen's Association Local 1814, in particular reluctantly participating in strikes, and wishing the union would help him in his old age, particularly with his medical bills.  Massa discusses social activities such as playing billiards; attending church; and believing that younger generations do not know how to live as a community."

This interview covers Joseph Marino's childhood in Italy; his immigration to the United States (US); and work in the garment industry in New York, New York.  Marino begins by describing his childhood in Italy, noting that his father immigrated to the US when Marino was young in order to support his family.  He recalls wanting to come to the US as soon as he was able and and settling on Mott Street in the Little Italy neighborhood of Manhattan with his father and brother.  He notes his initial amazement at the size of New York City upon his arrival.  He explains that he started working as a  barber but did not like it, so he apprenticed himself at his brother's tailor shop.  Marino describes working for no pay for three and a half years while he learned the trade; having a dispute with both his manager and his brother over his meager wages when he did receive a salary; leaving his brother's shop and opening his own tailor shop; and closing his business and working for other custom tailor shops.  He recalls joining the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Local 162, emphasizing the union's involvement in limiting work hours and improving wages.  Other topics include his views on Catholicism; his daughter; his views on Richard Nixon and the Watergate scandal; a comparison of his hometown in Italy in the past and at the time of the interview; and his views on and activities in the community center he frequented at the time of the interview."

She explains that people in the southern US accepted segregation as a fact of life.  She describes meeting her first husband in college; running away from home to marry him in 1919; and living near Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, New York.  She discusses becoming a dancer while escorting her daughter's dance troupe across the US and becoming a dancer at the Cotton Club in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan when her daughter entered kindergarten.  She recounts her time at the Cotton Club, including feeding people in bread lines during the Great Depression with other performers; the segregation between the performers, who were black, and the audience members, who were white; and the code of conduct amongst the performers.  She discusses living with her daughter in England and France for three years while performing with a Cotton Club revue and hiring a private tutor for her daughter while in Europe.  "

She discusses her daughter's education.  She recounts living in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan in order to keep her daughter isolated from other African-American families.

Meeks discusses his family and his childhood in the Carolinas, including his two brothers; his grandparents, who were born enslaved; and the professions of many of his family members, including his mother's employment as a practical nurse and his father's employment in public works.  He recalls that the family was considered middle class; that his family attended church in Charlotte, North Carolina; an outbreak of smallpox in 1905, and other epidemics in North Carolina; and his participation in social activities such as church picnics.  He recollects his motivations for migrating to New York City, including the scarcity of work during the Great Depression; one of his aunts telling him that New York City was the best place to go for a better living; and his inability  to find work as a subcontractor because he was not a member of a union.  Meeks discusses the ways in which World War II (WWII) impacted his life, including using ration books; believing that the United States (US) government stole his car tires; being asked to donate aluminum pots and pans to the war effort; and not having a fear of Adolph Hitler attempting to attack the US.  He discusses his sons' wartime experiences, including their joining the military; being involved in D-Day; and being deployed to Japan.  "

Topics in this interview include Danny Meyers' family, his experience driving a taxi, and the process of unionizing taxi drivers.  Meyers discusses his family, including the fact that his father died when Meyers was seven; the fact that his family was very religious; and the fact that his family would have prefered that he had chosen a different profession.  He discusses the fact that his children continued to practice their Jewish faith as adults and the fact that he felt proud that all of his children had graduated from college.  He recollects his career driving a taxi, including starting during the Great Depression so that he would not have to ask for government assistance; being robbed and assaulted many times during his career; and playing cards with the other taxi drivers after a shift. Meyers recounts driving Fiorello La Guardia to a meeting at 3:00 in the morning and how this interaction led to La Guardia being the only politician that Meyers ever supported.  Meyers discusses in detail multiple attempts at unionization of taxi drivers; the support given by John L. Lewis, Mike Quill, and Jimmy Hoffa; the effects of these attempts; and his speculation as to why they were unsuccessful until 1966.  He elaborates on the benefits of unionization, including no longer needing to bribe the dispatcher in order to get a vehicle for the day; gaining larger commissions on each fare; creating solidarity within the taxi driving community; and believing that unionization was greatly beneficial to taxi drivers."

He recalls his early work in the garment industry, including getting his first job through his brother-in-law; beginning as a non-union employee because he did not have enough experience or training; refusing to work on Saturdays; having to borrow money from his brother-in-law to buy his first union dues book; and looking for new work consistently, due to the seasonal nature of the garment industry.

He discusses his election to multiple positions within the union, including assistant manager of the ILGWU Local 9; the manager of the Organizational Department; and a member of the Out-of-Town Department. He recalls the types of work he did within each position, including attempting to organize non-union shops; working with shop owners to keep union members employed; acting as a liaison between shop owners and union members; and passing all of his decisions in front of a union board so that no one could accuse him of corruption.  He discusses his involvement with the Socialist Party of America, including joining in 1914 in order to learn more about the movement; leaving the party when the Communist movement gained momentum, though still supporting Socialist ideals; and re-joining the party around 1940.  He briefly recounts his involvement with the Workmen's Circle in Manhattan, including being pushed to run for office; being minimally active due to time constraints with his work at the ILGWU; and appreciating that he was provided with excellent medical care throughout his membership."

She describes her work experiences and union activity in the garment industry in New York, including her work as a finisher; the working conditions and salaries in the garment factories; her anxiety over not being able to earn enough wages when paid for piecework; and her participation in a dressmakers' strike in 1933.  She describes her and her family's experiences with racial discrimination in New York, including segregation in movie theaters and her father's underemployment due to racist hiring practices.  She discusses her social activities, including attending church and enjoying going to movies and baseball games, particularly the New York Giants."

She describes her immigration to the United States in 1912 and her work with her sister to earn enough money to send for their mother in 1914.  She recalls that her aunt helped her get her first job as a seamstress on Manhattan Avenue in New York City, noting that she was instructed to hide in the bathroom whenever a customer entered the shop because she looked too young to be working.  She recalls her membership in the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) Local 25; the organization of local garment shops; and strikes for better wages, which were often defeated by strikebreakers brought in by the employers.  She describes having an especially strong bond with Italian immigrants due to their shared immigrant experience and their work together membership in the ILGWU.

He explains that General Electric would not hire him due to his Jewish heritage and so he sought work in the garment industry.  He recounts moving to Greenville, South Carolina at the behest of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) in order to augment the development of the garment industry and the ACWA's presence in the southern US; sending his paychecks back to his family in New York; and visiting his family every two or three months.

She explains that a friend wrote to her brother in New York and begged him to help his sister during the turbulent aftermath.  She recalls moving to New York on April 30, 1931, where she worked as a domestic worker and as a laborer in an arms factory during World War II.  She recounts lining up at 167th Street and Jerome Avenue in the Bronx for daywork and the fact that women often undercut one another by offering to work for less.  She recalls spending most of the years after her heart attack in 1949 playing the organ and piano for various churches, especially after a religious experience she had in the 1960s drew her back to her dedication to Christianity.  Other topics include some history and genealogy of her family; her views on God and religion; the differences between life in the countryside and life in the city; and her work as a musician at senior citizen centers at the time of the interview."

This interview covers Isidore Opochinsky's life in Hungary; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1921; his work as a fur machine operator in New York, New York; and his union activity.  Opochinsky tends to mumble and is sometimes hard to understand.  He provides few details about his childhood and early life in Europe, focusing on his involvement in the General Jewish Labour Bund of Lithuania, Poland, and Russia.  He recalls that he learned of the importance of unionization and the tenets of Socialism through members of the Bund.  He notes that members of the Bund who immigrated to the US had an easier time acclimating because they had the resources and social ties of an organized group.  He explains that he worked without pay for six months while he trained in the fur industry in Europe.  He recounts immigrating to the US in 1921, because he could not make a living in Europe after World War I, and settling with his brother in New York, New York.  He explains that he returned to Europe after a conflict with an unspecified fur workers' union (likely the International Fur and Leather Workers Union).  He discusses his return to the United States when he could not find work in Europe and his vow to rid the union of those in power who monopolized its funds and activities.  He recalls neglecting his education and his family in order to reorganize the leadership of the union, noting that after his removal of the corrupt leaders, the resulting chaos provided an opportunity for the Communists gain power.  He describes a strike that occurred in 1926, including the fact that it lasted 26 weeks; that the police killed many of the strikers; and that the strikers won, earning medical benefits and better hours and wages.  Other topics include details of the work of the fur industry; a comparison of labor unions and living and working conditions in Europe and the US; and his attendance and involvement in an unspecified conference concerned with Jewish labor issues in Geneva, Switzerland."

In addition to Frank Pane, there is an unknown man who intermittently comments on the interviewers' questions.  This interview covers Pane's childhood in Italy, his immigration to the United States, and his life and work as a bookbinder and longshoreman in New York, New York.  Pane discusses his family history, noting the contrast between his father, who was a relatively poor longshoreman, and his mother, who had inherited two large homes from her parents.  He recounts how his father's schooner was destroyed by a steamboat while at sea and how the steamboat crew, who were headed to the United States, brought him with them, and he settled in New York in order to acquire more job opportunities.  Pane and the rest of his family immigrated to the United States later in 1898 via the ship Victoria.  He describes the poor living conditions that many immigrants, including his family, endured.  He notes that during the the depressions before and after World War I, Father Vogel at the Saint Charles Chapel on Van Brunt and President Streets in Brooklyn, New York would distribute food and coal tickets to poor families.  He describes evading the draft during World War II in order to support his family and shifting his occupation from bookbinder to work as a caulker in the shipyards.  He notes that he liked the work due to the outdoor environment, a stark contrast to the dirty factories that he had worked in as a bookbinder, but disliked the inconsistent employment.

Prescant describes her hometown in Poland, noting that although there was no open hostility between the Jewish people and other religious populations, the local school did not accept Jewish students.  She recalls learning Hebrew at a Jewish school; learning how to sew at a local tailor shop; and working on the family farm.  She explains that she chose to immigrate to the US because there were no Jewish men for her to marry and no doctors in her town.  She mentions that some of her other siblings emigrated in order to avoid being drafted into the Russian Army or being persecuted for their belief in Socialism.  "

She discusses her husband, including how they met and his death 12 years after their marriage.

He attended school in Germany for eight years before moving into the workforce as a baker when he was 18 years old, joining a bakers' union in Hamburg.  Preuhs served in the German merchant marine and the German Navy before he immigrated to the United States (US) in January 1911.  He lived in the Beggars' Boarding House on 5th Street between 1st and 2nd Avenue in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York before getting his own apartment.  He worked as a baker and joined an unspecified bakers' union in New York (likely the Journeymen Bakers Union of New York)."

This interview covers Albert Preuhs' childhood and early adult life in Germany; his immigration to the United States (US); and a summary of his life in New York, New York.  Preuhs begins by describing his father's work in a bakery in Hamburg, Germany, noting his membership in a local union and his progression from employee to manager of his own business. He describes working as an apprentice for three years before traveling to various German cities during his time as a journeyman.  Preuhs explains that he joined the German merchant marine in order to travel and was subsequently drafted into the German Navy in 1906, serving on a warship stationed in Hamburg.  Upon his discharge from the Navy, he acquired a position on a merchant ship and illegally jumped ship in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1911.  He describes settling in the Beggars' Boarding House on 5th Street between 1st and 2nd Avenue in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, noting the ease with which he found work due to the myriad of small German bakeries in the city.  He explains that he worked in many of these bakeries in different parts of the city and moved often in order to live near or in his current workplace.  Other topics from his life in the US include the seasonal nature of the baking industry; his time working in Chicago, Illinois; and the development of technology in the baking industry and its role in the obsolescence of many physical laborers."

Throughout the interview, Raia speaks in both Italian and English.  Topics of discussion include Raia's family, his emigration from Sicily, Italy, his relationship with his wife and children, his work in the United States (US), and his union involvement.  Raia discusses his immigration to the US, including his grandparents immigrating prior to his immigration; sending for his siblings to join him after the death of their father in 1920; and leaving Sicily for economic and social reasons.  He recalls meeting his wife after one of her singing performances; having three children with her; feeling proud of his children's accomplishments; believing that men and women need to be treated as equals; and training his wife as a machine operator in a dress factory.  He recalls different jobs he held, including work at a piano factory; on submarines in the Brooklyn Navy Yard; for the American Can Company; in shoe manufacturing; and as a part-time actor.  He discusses his union involvement, including being a member of the Boot and Shoe Workers Union and an unspecified millinery union; serving on the executive board of the Boot and Shoe Workers Union; being involved in multiple strikes; and being called a Communist because of his involvement with unions."

This interview covers Reid's childhood in Jamaica; his immigration to the United States (US); and work as a carpenter in Charleston, South Carolina and New York, New York.  Reid begins by describing his childhood in Jamaica, noting that his grandfather owned a blacksmithery and a farm that was relatively self-sufficient, growing produce and raising livestock for the family.  Reid describes his time at Mt. Zion School, noting his position as a teacher's aide once he reached the upper levels of elementary school and the fact that his mother wanted him to become a teacher, an occupation he had little interest in pursuing.  He discusses the history and genealogy of parts of his family and race relations in Jamaica.  He explains that when he was 16 years old, he became an apprentice to carpenters employed by his cousin, noting that he learned general carpentry and built houses and factories in Jamaica.  Reid explains that he immigrated to the US in 1919 and acclimated to the United States in Charleston, South Carolina with a different cousin because of the warm weather there.  He describes encountering segregation in the southern United States, noting that he ignored these restrictions with few repercussions.  He describes working for the Standard Oil Company and recalls the racial segregation of the workforce.  He recounts joining Local 52 of an unspecified carpenters' union in Charleston; its two locals organized by race; and the specific territories marked for where each local's members were allowed to work.  Reid provides an extended description of his job with the Consolidated Gas Company in Charleston, noting the details of his work and his relationship with the foreman.  He discusses his work at an unspecified company in New York owned by Philip Egensky.  Other topics include his involvement with a church in Jamaica; his leisure activities; a comparison between race relations in the northern and southern United States; and his participation in cricket leagues in both Jamaica and the US."

The interview covers Evadni Richards' early life in Jamaica, her immigration to the United States (US), her work in the garment industry, and her union activity.  Richards discusses her early life in Jamaica, including her education at a dressmaking school in Kingston and her decision to immigrate to Cuba with a friend.  She discusses working as a domestic worker and companion in Cuba before immigrating to the US in 1922.  She discusses her brother's business as a shoemaker in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan and his illness, which led to his return to Jamaica in 1924 and left her alone in the US.  She discusses her work in the garment industry, including her wages; her work in the designing room doing handwork; and the other West Indians who worked in the factory with her.  She compares Jamaica and New York from her childhood and the 1920s, in particular that there was no segregation in schools or churches; the influence of colonialism in the workplace; and that wages were better in New York, despite still being relatively little.  She discusses discrimination in the garment industry; her opinion that all workers, regardless of race or ethnicity, faced a certain amount of discrimination; and racial discrimination she faced in the garment industry, in particular not being allowed to work as a designer despite her training.  She recounts being chosen to learn to operate a special sewing machine despite being the only black worker in the factory.  "

The interview covers Fannie Rief's childhood in Austria, her immigration to the United States (US), her working life, and her family life.  Rief recounts aspects of her early life in Austria, including brief biographies of her siblings.  She recounts not attending school as only boys were formally educated and teaching herself to read and write Yiddish.  She discusses anti-Semitism, wondering why it exists, and her belief that Jews were treated better in Austria than in Germany and Russia.  She recounts immigrating alone to the US in 1907 and living with a family friend in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  She describes working as a servant for a number of Jewish families in New York City.  She discusses her belief that although life in the US was hard, it was better than her life in Europe and describes ways in which new immigrants helped each other acclimate to life in the US.  She discusses the decline in religious adherence in US amongst Jewish immigrants.  She recalls her husband's career as a machine operator in a ladieswear shop and his activity in an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union).  She discusses her son's education, his marriage, and his worry over her health and well-being."

Robinson begins by describing her childhood in Plaisance, British Guiana, recalling how discipline and the desire to make something of herself were instilled in her through her household chores, education, and corporal punishment.  She describes the racial demographics of her classmates as being mostly black but not feeling animosity between the black and East Indian populations of British Guiana; and not experiencing racial discrimination and prejudice until she lived in the US.  She discusses Great Britain's relationship with British Guiana and her work as secretary in a Marcus Garvey club in British Guiana.  "

She recounts a trip she and her husband took to the southern US after they were married, focusing on her initial experience with racial discrimination in the US and how it made her wary of people.  She describes moving near Linden Boulevard in Brooklyn  in order to provide a safer environment and better educational opportunities for her children.  "

This interview covers Dominick Rocco's childhood in Procida, Italy; his illegal immigration to the United States (US) in 1924; and his life and work as a longshoreman in Brooklyn, New York.  Rocco begins the interview by describing his childhood in Italy; his father's cargo ship business; and the changes in Procida from when he left to the time of the interview, noting an increase in educational opportunities and a decrease in the number of people employed in labor-intensive jobs.  He discusses being encouraged to immigrate to the US after seeing the success of his father's workers who would go to the US and return to Italy wealthier.  He explains that his immigration in July 1924 impeded him from acquiring his citizenship until 1948.  He recounts his settling on 2nd Street in Brooklyn with his cousin's family and immediately working as a longshoreman.  He recalls joining the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) but notes that its early incarnations were weak and indistinct due to its lack of communication and organization, especially during the Great Depression.  He discusses the fact that longshoremen were predominantly Italian and notes that the large need for the occupation dwindled over time and will perhaps completely disappear in the future.  He describes living in a predominantly Italian neighborhood in which there were many large families of four to five children and that the older generations made sure to pass the traditions of their homeland to the next generation.  Other topics include his marriage and subsequent move to 49th Street and Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn in 1929; his first time taking the 7th Avenue subway in 1924; and his belief in building a better life for himself in the US."

Rockwell describes his hometown, noting his work on the family farm and differences in the town between his childhood and the time of the interview.  He notes that there was a distinction between men's work and women's work, with men fishing and women working on the farms or in tomato factories.  He explains that he left Virginia when he was 16 years old because he had heard that jobs and wages were better in Atlantic City.  He describes working in construction in Ocean City, New Jersey; liking the lack of a union; marrying his first wife; and going to baseball games, pool rooms, dances, and church during his free time.  He discusses segregation in his neighborhood; transitioning from construction work to cooking for job security; and his preference for the Postal Savings System over banks.  He describes moving to New York; working odd jobs because of the lack of steady work; and returning to Virginia when his grandmother became sick.  Other topics include the relationship between Baltimore, Maryland and his hometown; his time in the Army during World War II; his political affiliation; and his religious beliefs."

She discusses her early life in Hungary, including living with an aunt and uncle in Hungary while the rest of her family returned to the United States (US).  She discusses her education, her parents' separation, and her aspiration to become a psychiatrist.  She recounts meeting her husband; moving to Budapest with him after World War I; and deciding to emigrate once Béla Kun came to power.  She discusses her immigration to the US and her reunion with her family.  She recounts meeting her younger siblings and feeling shocked at the transformation of her family from upper middle class intellectuals to people concerned only with the management of the family shoe store.  She discusses her rebellion against her eldest brother, Henry, who controlled every aspect of the family, from how their business was run to how the family would vote in political elections.  "

At first Lily Campanile, Rose Davy, Agnes Mazza, and Giacomina Pasqua discuss their husbands' work as longshoremen and the ways in which they would acquire jobs.  They quickly start talking over one another and the interviewers decide to speak to the women in smaller groups.  Angelina Saltalamacchia and Rose Davy are recorded together.\n  \nThe interview with Angelina Saltalamacchia focuses on her husband's work as a longshoreman, but also covers his working life in Italy and in the United States (US) before becoming a longshoreman; their immigration to the US; her working life before their marriage; and their children.  She discusses her husband's career as a longshoreman in the US, including how hard he worked; his salary; and the amount of compensation they received after he sustained a workplace injury.  She recounts the different jobs he held in the US before he became a longshoreman, including working for an unspecified telephone company in New York City and as a clerk in a store.  She discusses her reasons for immigrating to the US and other family members who immigrated before her.  She describes different jobs she had before her marriage; her work as a machine operator in garment factories; lists the locations of the factories in New York City and what each produced; and the work she did at each factory.  She describes her unhappiness at her first job, due to not being able to speak or understand English.  She discusses her children, including their birth dates; the death of one from leukemia; and the occupations of her surviving children."

Main topics include Charles Saggese's immigration to the United States (US); his employment; his marriage and family; his leisure activities; and his political and religious views.  Saggese discusses his immigration to the US at the age of 14; his father's promise that he could return to Italy if he did not like the US; and his belief that he would find gold in the streets in the US.  He recalls his employment, including becoming a barber at his wife's urging but having to close his barber shop after he developed an allergy to the perfumes; working as a salesman for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company; and working as an elevator operator.  He discusses attempting to unionize the elevator workers in his building in 1936 and joining the Building Service Employees International Union Local 32B.  He discusses his marriage, including asking his wife to refrain from working after they married because he believed it was the husband's job to provide for his wife.  Saggese discusses his children, in particular his son's education as an engineer and his work on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.  He recalls leisure activities in which he participated, including attending the opera and joining the St. Rosalie Club likely affiliated with his parish, where he served as a secretary.  He discusses his political views, including being a registered Democrat and having a polling place in his barber shop.  He discusses his views on religion, including considering himself Catholic but not attending church regularly and his belief that all religions were essentially the same."

Sansone discusses the perception that Italian Americans are family oriented and will support each other through any difficulty; her work to reveal this perception as false; and her founding of CIAO in order to provide a support network for Italian Americans.  She addresses the problem of Italian American students dropping out of high school and her work to lower the dropout rate with different organizations including the Search for Education, Elevation, and Knowledge Program (SEEK).  She discusses the popularity of the CIAO center in Brooklyn and their daycare and senior citizen programs."

This interview covers Joseph Savio's childhood in Italy, his immigration to the United States (US) in 1901, and his life in New York, New York up to the time of the interview.  Savio briefly describes living in Italy, noting that there was a severe economic divide between those who owned property and those who did not.  He discusses his family's immigration, with his parents and younger siblings following the earlier immigration of his older siblings.  He recounts the family settling in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan; briefly attending school on Solomon Street; struggling to learn English; working as a delivery boy; and being apprenticed to a glove cutter.  He discusses his work pressing and cutting the fingers of gloves; perfecting his trade; becoming the foreman of the Steinberg Company for several years; and opening his own business on East 28th Street.  He describes the working conditions of the glove factories as filthy, noting that he contracted a disease from the fumes produced in processing the gloves.  Other topics include Italian immigrants' opinions on World War I and World War II; the shift in economic and living conditions in the US during the wars; discrimination faced by Italians and Jews in the areas he lived; and differences between New York City and his hometown."

This interview was conducted in Italian with the aid of a translator who is often hard to hear.  Topics include Schiano's life in Italy, his family, work as a longshoreman, and leisure activities. Schiano discusses his early life in Italy including having eight siblings; marrying and having children; and working as a sailor.  He remembers immigrating to the United States (US) twice: once on his own and then again with his wife and children. He discusses leisure activities in Brooklyn, New York, including trips to Prospect Park, museums, and Coney Island; reading only Italian newspapers; and listening to Italian music, but not Italian opera. He discusses feeling grateful for the opportunities in the US  and identifying as a Democrat.  Other topics include being a member of the International Longshoremen's Association Local 1814; finding employment through friends; and working on the docks because he no longer wanted to go out to sea.  He speaks at length about his children, including how they spoke to him in Italian while they spoke English amongst themselves; that he supported them until they married so that they would have savings; and his insistence that they attend school rather than work.  He specifically describes feeling proud of his son for attending college."

The audio recording for this interview is missing. This interview covers Geraldo Scotto's childhood in Italy; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1920; and his work as a longshoreman in Brooklyn, New York.  Scotto explains that he was the first member of his family to immigrate to the US.  He describes the work of longshoremen; working conditions on the docks; the demographics of the longshoremen; and the development of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) and its impact on longshoremen.  He explains that, although he moved three times while in the US, he always remained in Brooklyn, specifically in Italian communities near many of his friends and family from Italy.  He notes that he did not speak English when he came to the US; that he learned what he knows of the language from his wife, friends, and coworkers; and that he did not experience any discrimination, though he did have trouble finding a job when he first arrived in the US.  Other topics include a trip he took to Italy in 1958; his religious beliefs; his children's living and working situations at the time of the interview; and his leisure activities."

Seltzer recounts her early life in a small town near Minsk, Russia, including being a member of  the Jewish community in a town populated by both Jews and Christians and being taught to read and write Hebrew or Yiddish by a tutor in her home.  She describes her management of her household; her care of her younger siblings after her mother died; and her difficult relationship with her stepmother, which led to her immigration to the United States (US).  Her memories of life in New York City in the early 20th century include reacting to the difference in fashions and hairstyles; eating ice cream for the first time; and learning to use a straw.  She recounts her first job in a factory, including learning to use sewing machines and being fined for being late to work before becoming accustomed to time clocks.  She describes numerous attempts at organizing by unspecified unions in the factories in which she worked and her decisions to find new work when these attempts failed.  She recounts working at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory for one day before the fire in 1911 and describes the general darkness in the factory, the locked stairwells, and the fact that there was no drinking water for the workers.

This interview covers Herbert Sherman's childhood in Kolomea, Galicia, Austria-Hungary; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1921; and his life and work as a lawyer in New York, New York.  Sherman begins by describing his childhood in Kolomea, noting that his father immigrated to Canada in 1913 and from there to the US in 1914.  He explains that the prolonged absence of his father strengthened the relationship he had with his mother, a well-educated woman who inculcated in him the desire to get an education, and the impact of her death when he was 16 years old.  He recalls that Kolomea was on the border between Russia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire and, as a result, the town was often in the middle of border disputes.  He explains that his father sent for the family at the end of World War I, but they were unable to immigrate to the United States until 1921.  He discusses organizations that aided immigrants upon arrival in the United States, particularly the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and living conditions on the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  He recounts attending public school in New York, noting that the school had special classes to teach immigrants English.  He explains that he began working while he was attending Seward Park High School in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, varnishing sample cases for salesmen and preparing and delivering lunches to workers in a manufacturing company.

Siciliano often speaks Italian throughout the interview.  Luigi Barrara, another member of the Union, is present at the interview, often acting as a translator between Italian and English, as well as clarifying some details.  Topics include Siciliano's childhood in Italy, his early work in New York, New York, and his union involvement.  Siciliano recollects his early life in Italy, including going to school; working on a fishing boat in the summers; his father working on large ships; joining the Italian Navy; and trying to support his family.  His early memories of New York City include being required to join the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) Local 1814 in order to work; working on an Army Base at Pier 2 in Brooklyn; and deciding to become a longshoreman since it did not require working papers.  Siciliano discusses how the ILA affected his job, specifically mentioning strikes happening consistently every two years for ten to twenty days each; the $13 compensation provided for work injuries being insufficient; and work gangs that would become an important part of the job."

Sinclar discusses her son, including his moves to Phoenix, Arizona and Maine in an attempt to control his asthma; his graduation from the University of Maine and Howard University School of Law in Washington DC;  his decision to leave Harvard Law School for Howard University; his passing the bar exam in 1961; and his work for a Pacific Line train between attending Harvard and Howard.  She discusses working in a sweater factory on Broadway in Manhattan, New York; teaching Sunday school at Mount Olivet Baptist Church and Calvary Baptist Church in Manhattan; and participating in the Parent Teacher Association of her son's school.  She discusses the different churches she attended, including joining Mount Olivet Baptist Church in 1933; joining Abyssinian Baptist Church in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan in 1948, but disliking it because Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. spent more time in Washington, DC than Harlem; and joining Calvary Baptist Church in 1963, where she was still a member at the time of the interview."

He describes the creation of the United Furniture Workers of America (UFWA) in 1937 and the affiliation of his local with them.  He describes his work to unionize the factory at which he worked for the UFWA; a 26 week strike that followed the unionization of that factory; and he and his daughter being threatened by representatives of his employer.  He describes the ethnic and racial demographics of the original membership of the UFWA (predominantly Jewish) and the membership at the time of the interview (predominantly black and Puerto Rican).  He recounts meetings of the general membership being conducted and recorded in Yiddish, with the minority learning Yiddish in order to participate.  He discusses cultivating certain workers to be union officers; officers continuing to work in the shops as an officer's salary was not enough to live on; and this leading to officers having a better understanding of the needs of the general membership.  He discusses the union leadership at the time of the interview being paid a substantial salary and not having to continue working in the factories, which he felt led to a separation of the leadership from the general membership and inferior management of the union.

She explains the impact this had on her education experience, noting that the first school she attended, Public School (PS) 43, was a predominantly white school, where the teachers treated her well, but she often fought with other students when they called her racial slurs.  She recalls that when she transferred to PS 157, she expected to be treated fairly because there were more black students, but they ostracized her because she lived in a white neighborhood, which prompted fights with them.  Smith recounts her mother not understanding her aggressive reaction to racial slurs and attributes this to her being accustomed to such treatment due to growing up in Virginia.  She recounts her mother's time in Virginia and her experience migrating to New York; her mother's job as a chambermaid near Columbia University in Manhattan; the difference in the ways in which lighter and darker skinned black people were treated; and her experience at church and Sunday school.

She discusses the stigma associated with domestic work; her and her family's living and working conditions during the Great Depression; dating practices in Baltimore during the 1930s and 40s; the way in which she met and married her husband; and the limited job opportunities available to the black population in the 1940s."

She describes other industries in which she worked, including as a cook at the Rainbow Room at 30 Rockefeller Center in Manhattan; a packer in a garment factory; and as a saleswoman in Macy's.  She notes that she enjoyed these jobs more than domestic work because they had less restrictions and allowed her to meet a wide variety of people.  She recalls having to adjust her work schedule after her son was born in 1952, giving up her job at Macy's to take care of him when she was unable find a reputable babysitter.  Other topics include her husband's employment as a presser in the garment industry and his work for Con Edison; the ways in which women raised families and navigated discriminatory practices at work; a comparison of life in a city and in the country; a comparison of life in the southern and northern United States (US); the typical sequence of a family's migration from the southern to the northern US; and her frequent visits to her remaining family in West Virginia."

The interview covers Yetta Stein's early life in Vienna, Austria-Hungary; her immigration to the United States (US); her marriage; her working life; and her union activity.  Stein recounts the rape and pillage by Russian troops in Nadvirna in the Polish region of Austria-Hungary during World War I and the fact that this led her family to flee to Vienna.  She describes her life in Vienna as happy but constrained by latent anti-Semitism; the fact that she had many friends who were not Jewish; and her surprise at their overt anti-Semitism once Germany annexed Austria in 1938.  She recounts that some of her Jewish friends and family became Austrian citizens, but that she and her husband could not afford to do so, and that this saved their lives as the Nazis had no authority over Polish citizens at that time.  She recounts deciding to immigrate to the US in 1938 with her daughter; her husband staying in Vienna as he had no family in the US to sponsor his immigration; and the year her husband spent alone in Vienna destroying his mental health.

She explains that she was advised by the National Council of Jewish Women to move to St. Louis, Missouri so that she and her husband could learn trades without having to be members of a union.  She describes their apartment in St. Louis and how happy she was there.  She recalls that she and her husband both joined the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) in St. Louis.  She recalls that the ILGWU helped her find work in a factory in New York City, where she worked for the next 22 years.  She describes how much she enjoyed working in the factory; that she liked both the work and her co-workers; and that she made many friends there, both Jewish and West Indian.  She describes how important working outside the home was for the women at the factory and the pride they took in their work.  She explains the different jobs in the factory; how they were divided between men and women; and the different pay schedules across these jobs. Transcript and index are available for this interview."

She recalls her early experiences in New York, including feeling lonely and homesick for the first year; being teased due to her accent; being confused about how to use money; interacting with people of different races for the first time; and finding that a majority of the people she met were nice to her because she was from Ireland."

This interview covers Israel Tamovitz's life in Vilna, Russia; his involvement in the General Jewish Labour Bund of Lithuania, Poland, and Russia; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1910; and some of his life in Pennsylvania.  Tamovitz begins by explaining his involvement in the Bund, noting that he learned about the organization through word of mouth; began attending meetings held in the woods; and keeping his coworkers informed about demonstrations and proclamations against the czar.  He discusses the relationships among factions within and outside of the organization; the relationship between the people and the police; Tamovitz's arrest; and his brother's involvement in the Bund.

He describes the development of an unspecified miners' union in the Pennsylvania town where he settled; the impact John Mitchell and the miners' unions had on working conditions; and the decline of mining, which forced workers into other industrial occupations and trades.  Other topics include his brother's immigration to the US and the fate of members of his family that remained in Vilna during World War I and World War II."

The interview covers Benny Terranova's childhood, his family, his working life, and his union activity.  Terranova discusses his childhood; his education; his father's insistence that he leave school at age 14 to help in the bakery; and his father's indulgence of his children.  He discusses becoming interested in organizing his father's bakery as a member of an unspecified Italian bakers' union; working to organize other local bakeries; and becoming disillusioned with the industry.  He recounts his decision to become a longshoreman; his first jobs as a longshoreman; and unsafe conditions on the waterfront.  He recounts alternating between working on the waterfront and in the bakery for four years before switching to working as a longshoreman full time after seeing the work of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) to improve working conditions.  He discusses the frequent strikes organized by the ILA and how these led to steady increases in wages in the 1940s and early 1950s.  He describes the different jobs he held on the waterfront and his rise through the ranks, from working in the holds of the ships to being a superintendent working in an office.  He discusses officials of the ILA, in particular Anthony Anastasio and Joseph Ryan.  He describes the ethnic and racial demographics of the longshoremen in New York; the organization of ILA locals along racial and ethnic lines; and difficulties in organizing different racial and ethnic groups into one local.  He discusses the issues he felt were most important for longshoremen at the time of interview, including health and safety and improvement of pensions."

Thompson begins the interview by describing her childhood in Wilson, including her grandmother's plantation and the education and occupations that her siblings pursued.  She explains that she worked as a children's caretaker for multiple summers, noting that the family she worked for would go to Montauk, New York in order to visit the children's father, who was in the Navy.  She notes that these visits inspired her love for New York and prompted her to move to the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan with her husband and children in 1949.  Thompson briefly describes working as a substitute teacher for Public School 68 in the Bronx, New York and another unnamed school but notes that she went to work at Montefiore Hospital in 1959 in order to acquire better wages and more stable work."

This interview covers Tony Torres' migration from Puerto Rico to New York, New York, and his work in haberdasheries and a bakery.  Torres mentions that he, his mother, and his brother migrated to the New York, New York in 1918 in search of better economic opportunities.  He describes being sent to a series of orphanages after his mother died during the influenza epidemic in 1918.  He notes that while he did learn English in the orphanages, he also lost his native Spanish while living there and mentions that the orphans tended to stick together regardless of their nationality.  Torres explains that he worked various odd jobs until he found stable work in a haberdashery, emphasizing how specific trades were usually associated with specific social networks or ethnic groups.  He describes getting a job at a bakery through the newspaper; joining an unspecified bakers' union (likely the Journeymen Bakers Union of New York); being elected shop steward; and enduring a seven month strike for better wages and work hours.  He notes that, at the time of the strike, the union was composed of mostly independent locals that kept to themselves whereas, at the time of interview, the locals presented a more united front within the industry.

He notes the lack of organization and leadership in the Puerto Rican population, which he believes contributed to their lack of a political presence, particularly in New York City.  Other topics include the relationships between different immigrant populations where he lived and worked; New York City politics, predominantly focusing on Fiorello La Guardia and Vito Marcantonio; the surge in Puerto Rican migration to the United States in the 1940s; Puerto Rican involvement in politics; the development of labor unions, with emphasis on the inclusion of immigrant and minority groups; the mechanization of bakery work and its impact on bakers; his leisure time activities; and a comparison between the importance of religion to his generation of Puerto Ricans and younger generations."

This interview covers Primo Tossio's childhood in Rome, Italy; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1926; and his work as a longshoreman in New York, New York.  Tossio describes his childhood in Italy, noting that his education was cut short when his father fell ill and he had to work in order to support his family.  He recounts immigrating to the US illegally in January 1926; arriving in Baltimore, Maryland; and being assisted by local Italians on his way to New York. He describes his job as a longshoreman; his work in both Brooklyn and Staten Island; and the difficulty of loading ships due to the organizational work that accompanied it.  He recounts joining an unspecified union (likely the International Longshoremen's Association); gaining a greater sense of job security; moving into management positions including hatch foreman and superintendent; and sending most of his salary to his family in Italy.  Tossio focuses on the relationship between the workers and the stevedore, noting that the stevedore was paid more money.  He explains that the stevedore would not hesitate to fire someone whom he felt was not working hard enough and that he maintained a small group of favored workers whom he consistently employed."

She was raised by her stepmother before being sent to various relatives, one of whom abused her, which prompted one her teachers to gain custody of her.  She attended school in Vienna as well as other schools in northern Austria.  She married Rudolph Unger in 1912 when she was 15 years old.  They immigrated to the United States on December 24, 1920, staying with her brother-in-law before getting their own apartment on 65th Street and 1st Avenue in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  She worked as a domestic worker; as a worker in a perfume factory, as the chef, manager, and owner of Viennese restaurants in both New Hampshire and New York; and as a pattern maker and department head at McCall's."

This interview covers Margareta Unger's childhood in Austria; her immigration to the United States (US) in 1920; and her life and work in the US up to the time of the interview.  Unger begins by describing her childhood in Austria; her father's remarriage after her mother's death; his death, which left Unger with her stepmother, who was soon unable to care for her; and her movement among a series of relatives, one of whom physically abused her.  She describes returning to Vienna to attend high school; meeting her husband in a coffeehouse; and emphasizing her stepmother's disapproval in the difference in their ages.  She recalls renouncing her religion for her husband and enduring a protracted court battle to sever her stepmother's guardianship over her.  She explains that her husband's wealth was seized by the state as funds for World War I (WWI); her poverty during WWI; her immigration to Russia in 1917 after her husband was drafted into the Austrian Army and stationed there; and their illegal immigration back to Austria in order to avoid the Russian Revolution."

She recalls being frightened by the amount of brick houses in the US, thinking that these buildings were all jails, and living in a house with steam heat, a luxury reserved for the rich in Austria.  She notes that she was able to acclimate more easily to the US than her husband; quickly finding work as a domestic worker; renting a hotel in New Hampshire during one summer so that she could set up her own Viennese restaurant; struggling to find consistent employment; and teaching her husband English so he could become a chauffeur.  She recalls visiting her brothers-in-law in Brodhead, Wisconsin and Rockford, Illinois in 1934 and 1935 and her husband encouraging her to help them grow their business.  Unger discusses opening another restaurant on 280 Greenwich Street in Lower Manhattan, where she worked as the chef and manager while her husband worked the cash register and washed the dishes.  She recalls food shortages during World War II forcing them to close; finding work as a pattern-maker and later department head at McCall's; working with the pantograph machine; and disguising patterns sent to England so the company could avoid taxes.  Other topics include her interactions with the local authorities and the mafia in New York City; her trips to Austria and other European countries; her husband's illnesses and death; her health; and her volunteer activities after her retirement."

The narrator of this interview does not provide any information about himself.  This interview covers the reasons for black migration within the United States (US); the history of black sociopolitical movements; and the living and social conditions of black populations in northern cities in the US.  The narrator describes reasons black families would migrate from the southern US to the north, including a boll weevil infestation that severely damaged the cotton crop during the 1920s; the repression of minorities in the south; better education opportunities in the north; positive accounts from relatives; the economic opportunities created by the decreased immigration from Europe during World War I; and the idealistic mythology surrounding the north.  He recounts the ways in which racial segregation in the south gave rise to a black middle class that worked toward fulfilling the needs of the black community.  He elaborates on different sociopolitical movements that occurred between the Civil War and the time of the interview, noting that each of these developments assigned importance to different aspects of black life. He discusses Garveyism, the Tuskegee movement, the Niagara movement, and the development of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  Topics relating to these movements include the liberation of black people; the immigrationist movements; the development of the foundation of a strong black economy; and the legal struggles for social and political equality.  The narrator focuses on the logistics of the typical migration, including how a single family member, usually a young man, would establish the living and financial situation before the rest of the family moved.  He explains that black families typically settled in what he referred to as the black belts of the city, crowded areas with poor living conditions that were eventually alleviated by public housing projects.  Other topics include the exclusionary tendencies of labor unions, which led to black employees developing their own unions, especially for unskilled labor; the differences between the older and younger generations' forms of leisure and entertainment, and the differences between white and black families with the extended family playing a much larger role in black families."

This interview covers Uttaro's childhood in Italy; his immigration to the United States (US); and his life in Boston, Massachusetts, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and New York, New York up to the time of the interview.  Uttaro describes his childhood and young adult life as being influenced by liberal politics, recounting listening to Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta speak in his hometown and how he developed a strong dislike for rules and organization.  He describes immigrating to the US as a way to become independent of his family, particularly of his father's strict household rules.  He recalls his first moments in the US as frightening, describing how a stranger had to help him locate his cousin in Somerville, Massachusetts after he got off the train in Boston.  He recounts his life in Pittsburgh with his sister; his return to Boston; and his dual responsibilities as a presser working in a tailor shop during the day and as a student at night.  He describes his work as a presser as being seasonal and having to find various other jobs during the off-season.  He recounts marrying his wife in 1924; moving to New York by himself in 1927 to pursue better employment opportunities; and sending for his family a few months later.  He notes that he had no desire to become an American citizen until his son became upset about admitting at school that his father was not a citizen, and that doing so ostracized him from some of his Socialist friends.  He describes becoming a member of both the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) Local 89 and the Industrial Workers of the World, detailing the growth of the ILGWU despite tension between the Socialists and Communists within the union.  Throughout his interview, Uttaro emphasizes the practicality of compromise, noting that even though he was an active member of the union and a Socialist, he tended to criticize his affiliates when he believed they were pursuing their ideals to extremes.  He discusses taking part in a program through the union in which he visited older union members who lived alone after he retired at age 65."

Wagner begins by describing his childhood, noting that his mother's sister raised him and his siblings after his mother died.  He explains that he lived in a railroad flat on 235 East 80th Street in the Upper East Side and recounts having frugal meals and fighting with other children over broken boxes that were used as fuel for the stove.  He notes that he started working at nine years old in various jobs, including newspaper and grocery delivery boy.  He discusses he and his siblings' education; his time playing baseball; and the demographics of his neighborhood.  "

He recalls a nine month strike that occurred in 1921 when he finished his apprenticeship, noting that the strike failed due to strikebreakers brought in from England and the IAM declaring the strike unauthorized.  He describes working briefly for the New York Central Railroad as a track worker before working in the bedding industry and joining the Bedding, Curtain and Drapery Workers Union Local 140 of the United Furniture Workers of America.  He explains his involvement in both the industry and the union by covering topics such as the industry's filthy factory conditions; his participation in strikes in 1932 and 1934; his work in negotiating better pay and more holidays for Local 140's members; his time as an elected union officer in 1945; and his time as unofficial president of the union from 1947 to 1951.  Other topics include his activity in politics, specifically in an unspecified Democratic club; his time on the education committee of the IAM; his memories of hiding in local community members' houses in order to avoid the police during the machinists' strike of 1921; his love of playing pool; and his wife, who immigrated to the US from Germany in 1929."

This interview covers Walters' childhood in Saint Kitts; her immigration to the US;, her marriages and children; and her working life, predominantly as a nurse in Jersey City, New Jersey; Fort Benning, Georgia; and Brooklyn.  Walters begins by briefly describing her childhood in Saint Kitts, noting that she lived with her grandparents, aunt, uncle, and sister; and that her grandfather owned his own land.  She discusses her immigration to the US in 1917, including making herself appear older in order to board the ship; enduring the eight day voyage alone; and being unable to eat much.  Walters describes settling in Jersey City with her mother and stepfather, who were the superintendents of a 60 family apartment building, and how she started working rather than continuing her education.  She explains that she got her first job working as a telephone operator in her apartment building and was later hired as a nurse for the children of the Lerner family in Jersey City.  Walters explains that the Lerners and their staff treated her like family, and that the chauffeur and chef took a particular interest in her.  She recounts meeting and marrying a chauffeur from Virginia in 1922, noting that she separated from him when he lost his job during the Great Depression and had no inclination to find another one.  "

She describes taking a course in nursing while she lived in Fort Benning from 1956 to 1962; working night shifts as a baby nurse at the Brooklyn Community Hospital for 11 years when the family moved back to New York; and augmenting the household income when her husband retired from the Army.  She recalls joining an unspecified union while at the hospital (likely Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union) but notes that her hospital did not go on strike because the administration acquiesced to their demands once they saw what was happening in other hospitals in the area.  She describes her duties as a baby nurse and emphasizes the friendly relationship among the staff members in the hospital.  Other topics include the lives and occupations of her children; her living conditions during the Great Depression; and racial discrimination in Georgia."

He explains that many of his relatives had already immigrated to the US and some of his immediate family and distant relatives followed his family after their immigration.  He notes that the family made sure to help any new members adjust to life in the US.  He recalls attending an unspecified vocational school at which he learned carpentry, and working in the construction industry as a carpenter and mechanic.  He recalls working on the George Washington Bridge, Madison Square Garden, The Daily News Building, the subway in Queens, and schools near the City College of New York.  He joined an unspecified construction workers' union in New York City, which he remembers specifically for its assistance in reducing working hours.  Walters lived in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan and noticed that, while he felt safe in his neighborhood, there was a divide between the white and black populations.  He emphasizes the role of the sanitation workers in New York City, explaining that he believes that they are more important than the police because they keep the city clean.  He notes that while gangsters have consistently been a problem in New York City, narcotics have made the generation coming of age at the time of the interview more violent and destructive than their predecessors.  Other topics include his family's religion; a comparison of the relevance of the church in the past and at the time of the interview; the importance of a construction worker's tools; his experience during the Prohibition era; racial and ethnic segregation and discrimination in New York City neighborhoods; his leisure time in a book club; and a comparison of New York City in the past and at the time of the interview."

The interview covers Angelina Wanderling's working life, her union activity, and her family.  Wanderling discusses her early work experiences in garment factories, including not enjoying section work because of the repetition, and looking for better jobs.  She discusses her attempts at organizing factories in which she worked and the opposition she met from immigrant workers who were afraid to lose their jobs.  She describes herself as aggressive and dissatisfied with the poor working conditions in the factories, but understanding the hesitation of the other workers.  She recounts a strike in 1932 and 1933 led by the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) in which she convinced her co-workers to participate; one factory where workers had not joined the strike and her decision to disconnect the factory's electricity; and the benefits the ILGWU gained for them after the strike.  She discusses her work as the chairlady in the factory, in particular convincing management that the work involved more than sewing and that workers' examination of the garments and adaption to new styles should be included in their salary.  She discusses her decision to leave and return to the workforce at different times, the types of work she performed, and the salaries she received. "

The interview covers Jean Weiner's childhood in Bessarabia, Russia; her family's life after their immigration to the United States (US); her working life; and her union activity.  Weiner describes the daily life of her family in Bessarabia in great detail, including specifics on her father's tailoring business; the food her mother would prepare for the family; how her mother made extra money while her father was in the US; and the importance her father placed on education.  She describes the different types of apartments the family rented as they moved into better apartments in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York before being able to afford a private house on Vermont Street in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn.  She recounts that the family had boarders; that her many relatives would frequently visit; how she enjoyed having so many people in the house; and that family and friends would help each other in times of need or illness.  She compares the way the family lived in Russia to their life in the US, describing the variety of meat that was available in the US; the way the family shopped for food and goods, mainly from pushcarts on Rivington Street in the Lower East Side; and the different status levels amongst the working class in both countries, which were determined by a person's profession.  She recounts her working life, which began soon after she arrived in the US; how much money she was expected to contribute to the household; the division of labor between men and women; and the fact that there were certain jobs that only men could do.

She discusses deciding to take a vacation from work as she had enough money to do so and spending the summer with her mother and siblings in Huntington, Connecticut; she and her sister flirting with young men in front of a country store near their camp; and meeting her husband through one of these men.  Other topics include the family's more secular life in the US; the Jewish street gang, The Little Augies; life in Jewish neighborhoods in New York City; and pride in her ability to work so that her youngest brother and sister were able to graduate high school and attend college."

The interviewer and location are unknown.  The interview covers Helen Taub Weinstein's childhood in Austria-Hungary; her family's immigration to the United States (US); her family's religious beliefs; her encounters with anti-Semitism in Austria-Hungary and the US; and her personal life.  Weinstein describes her childhood outside of Krakow and the resort her parents owned there.  She describes Franz Joseph I's lenient attitude towards the Jewish population, in opposition to the majority of the population of Austria-Hungary.  She recounts her family's decision to emigrate due to rising anti-Semitism in 1911 or 1912.  She discusses the family's resort in Monticello, New York and her work there.  She recalls teaching Polish at the school in Monticello and being paid in fruit and vegetables as she did not have a teaching license.  She discusses the difference in religious observance between her parents' generation and her own and the anti-Semitism her children faced in school in Queens and Long Island.  She describes the loneliness she feels as an older person isolated from her family and the devastation she felt over the death of her oldest son during World War II."

This interview covers Ellen Williams' childhood in Darliston, Jamaica; her immigration to the United States (US); and her life and work as a baby nurse and a nurses' aide in New York, New York.  Williams begins by describing her childhood in Jamaica, specifically recalling her father's occupation as a coachman in Kingston; the perception of this job as prestigious due to the wages and uniforms; and his occupation later as a pimento and coffee farmer in Darliston.  She recalls that despite the racial segregation in the schools and churches, children were generally friendly with one another.  She describes working as a baby nurse for a family in Jamaica, noting that they treated her like family; deferred to her on matters regarding their children; and introduced her to politicians and other friends of theirs.  She discusses the differences between life in the city and in the country; the different roles of men and women in both the household and society; the finances of her household; Catholic traditions, including holiday services and the role of godparents; and other secular traditions, particularly birthdays and festivals."

Her initial impression of New York City was that it was filled with trees and well-dressed people.  She explains that while her cousins helped her to acclimate to life in New York, she had difficulty adapting to the winter weather.  She describes working as a baby nurse for various families in New York City, recalling that after her marriage in 1948, she only took jobs that did not require her to live with her employers.  She describes her work and training as a nurse's aide at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  Williams recalls joining Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union in 1963 or 1964 and notes that despite her initial skepticism of its benefits, the union gave hospital workers greater job security and wage increases.  Other topics include the differences between her work as a baby nurse and nurse's aide; her siblings' education, careers, and families; her husband's occupation and family; her interactions with and impressions of union leaders, particularly Doris Turner and Leon Davis; her involvement in the West Indian and American Friendly Society and St. John's Lodge; and her visits to Jamaica to see her family."
