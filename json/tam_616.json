Estela and Ernesto Bravo moved to Cuba in the early 1960s, and as a result many of Estela's films focus on political and cultural relations between the United States and Cuba. The collection contains over 1,300 video tapes and film reels recorded by Bravo throughout her career. In addition to full-length features and video footage, the collection contains a small amount of ephemera, correspondence, home movies, and documentation related to the promotion and licensing of Bravo's films. Footage in this collection consists of interviews with political leaders and celebrities; scenes of historical events, marches, demonstrations, and performances; battle footage; clips from Cuba's State Council archives; speeches by Fidel Castro, Nelson Mandela, and others; and background footage (b-roll) used in finished films. This footage is primarily recorded on U-matic and Betacam video tapes, and produced on film reels, VHS, and DVD for screening and distribution. This collection has been partially digitized, and only the digitized footage is currently accessible to researchers."

She describes the types of people who came to her camps and the effect of the revolution on the religious community in which she lived. She explains that her camps were allowed to operate much like they did before the revolution, although government required the camps seek permission to operate. She discusses her family in the United States and the difficulties of traveling between the two countries. She also talks about what she sees as the positive and negative changes in Cuba since the revolution. At the end of the video she shares her personal philosophy in both English and Spanish, and explains that her biggest desire in life is to do God's will and help others embrace his message."

She was a dancer who trained with Martha Graham and studied at the Julliard School. In 1953 she met a young Cuban, Manuel Pineiro, who was studying business administration at Columbia. They married in New York but he left for Cuba to join Castro's forces shortly after their wedding. She joined him in 1955 and lived in Cuba for the rest of her life. Burdsall taught at the National Dance School and was a founding member of Conjunto Nacional de Danza Moderna, which she eventually directed. Burdsall was with the company for nearly 20 years and created numerous works reflecting the spirit of the Cuban people. In 1977 she became the national director of dance and modern dance advisor to the Minister of Culture."

                                                "This interview with Paul (Pablo) Menendez begins with a discussion about how he first traveled to Cuba to study music when he was 14 years old. He explains that his mother, singer Barbara Dane, performed in Cuba and later arranged for him to attend a music school there in 1966. He explains that youth in California in the 1960s were detached and had a very pessimistic view of the future. He explains that  life in Cuba at that time felt very different and students were engaged in political climate of the early revolutionary government. He describes meeting his wife at the school he attended, and explains that they married after he had only lived in Cuba for a year. He was only 15 years old at the time."

It begins with his wife discussing her experience of being married to an American. She discusses visits to the United States, including New York City and California, and describes the experience as a first-hand lesson in capitalism. She discusses the reason she chose to live in Cuba over a life in the United States, and explains that as an actress she would rather perform in her country. Their son also joins the conversation and discusses his education at a music school where he is studying classical guitar. Menendez then discusses freedom of expression in Cuban music, and certain restrictions that the state places on music that it distributes. He ends with a brief discussion about his hopes for the world in the post-colonial era of the late-20th century."

Finally, they briefly discuss the housing shortage in Cuba, and explain that the shortage has forced them to share a home with their two adult daughters and grandchildren."

Moore and Rios discuss what their lives were like prior to the Cuban revolution and their decision to stay in Cuba. Moore discusses her identity as an American living in Cuba, and her relationship with her family living in America. She explains that her family is not sympathetic to the revolution, and expresses disappointment that US and Cuba have not maintained better relations. Both Rios and Moore discuss how the revolution shaped the direction of their lives, and explain that they stayed in Cuba because of their positive impressions of Fidel Castro. They also briefly discuss raising children in Cuba and the community of Americans who came to live in Cuba following the revolution. Much of the interview features loud background noises that make portions difficult to hear."

The interview begins with Paskalitis introducing her family and explaining how they came to live in Cuba. She explains that her husband Paul, who was a Greek maritime worker, was deported from the United State during the McCarthy era. Paskalitis explains that Paul's union activism made him a political target during the McCarthy era, and her children describe the impact of his deportation on their family. Paskalitis describes how the family moved to Cuba in 1960 when Paul took a job working for the Cuban fishing industry. The family talks generally about adjusting to life in Cuba, their work, and their identities as Greek, American, and Cuban."

Proctor begins by discussing how she first moved to Cuba in 1971 after traveling to the country with the progressive student group the Venceremos Brigade. She explains that she felt at home in Cuba and decided to stay after being expelled from her American high school because of her political activism. Proctor and her mother talk about racism in the United States, and Proctor explains that as a biracial woman she has felt more in welcome Cuba. She also discusses US policy toward Cuba, her hopes that the US embargo against Cuba will end, and her sense of shame about America's treatment of Cuba. At the end of the interview she expresses her hope that all of her cousins and nephews could come to Cuba to meet her Cuban family. Video quality of this recording is poor in places."

Some of the Americans featured in the documentary lived in Cuba prior and decided to remain after the new government was established, while others decided to immigrate to Cuba in the period following the revolution. This series contains footage from the 43-minute film, including interviews with women such as Elfriede Mahler; Marjorie Moore; Lorna Burdsall; Lois Kroehler, a missionary, music teacher and peace advocate who came to Cuba in 1949; Jean McEvoy and Ellen Rosensweig, who is interviewed with her husband and children and comments on the differences between her life in Cuba and her visits to see her family in California. Footage from this film contains one-on-one interviews, performances, discussions in the street or in other venues, and scenes of the various locations where the women live."

The footage shows Barrantes speaking with community members and shows children drinking milk that the local government supplies to hungry children in the city. The video then features a teacher from a local school who explains how the program works. Many of the parents and educators featured in brief interviews mention that prior to the program the children in the village had never tasted milk."

García calls for unity among Latin American nations to fight against the crisis of foreign debt facing their countries. He criticizes wealthy nations in the north, international banks, creditors, and global financial organizations for taking advantage of Latin America. He argues that economic imperialism has led to Peru's fiscal crisis and has created extreme suffering and poverty in Peru. He contends that the only way to push back against the insurmountable debt payments is through unity among Latin American nations."

Then at minute 8:45 it changes to footage of on-the-street interviews in Argentina. Estela Bravo asks several individuals about the country's political situation and foreign debt. Several of the interviewees express frustration with the country's politics, arguing that there is high unemployment and little opportunity for the average citizen to create political change. Several individuals discuss the country's foreign debt. They question the government's ability to pay its debt and argue that average communities suffer in poverty in the meantime."

Bravo then interviews several children on the street who are taking drugs and asks them why they were attracted to drugs."

Many talk about the negative consequences of the debt on the country's children, poor, and elderly. Estela Bravo asks many members of the crowd what will happen if Argentina decides not to pay the debt. Many express their concern that the poor will suffer, and others discuss the possibility of Latin American countries collectively deciding not to pay the debt. One member of the crowd suggests that without unity among Latin American nations the decision to not pay would result in economic chaos. Several men in the crowd note that they have been out of work for many years, and others speculate about what will happen in Argentina's future."

Some individuals suggest that the debt is the fault of the investing class, while others express their concerns about the poor and the lack of investment in schools and social services. Several members of the crowd argue about whether Peru should pay the debt or whether they should attempt to resist foreign investors and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In another short interview two boys tell the story of a child who was abandoned in a park by his impoverished parents. At minute 14:00 the video changes to an interview with Peruvian economist Óscar Ugarteche. He describes the conditions that led to the debt crisis in Peru and expresses his skepticism about the country's ability to pay the debt."

In the interview, which was recorded in the mid-1980s, Ugarteche explains that the crisis had been building for over 10 years, and while the government focused on paying its international debt, it was not investing in the economy. He discusses the crisis of poverty, childhood hunger, and unemployment, and discusses economic changes that he thinks the country should take to emerge from the crisis.

It begins with two teachers at a kindergarten discussing the services they provide for poor children in the community. They describe the schools as a consistent source of food for local children. They also discuss high unemployment in the country and child malnutrition. The footage shows the children in the school singing songs and participating in a lesson on the alphabet. The video then changes to street footage of a slum outside of Bogotá where one of the teachers discusses the effects of foreign debt on the economy, the growth of slums, her Christian belief in Liberation Theology, and efforts to improve conditions in poor communities in the city. The video then cuts to footage of a different part of the city showing children selling goods on the street."

The footage begins with an interview with the priest who supports the center. He discusses the problem of hunger in the community and explains that they feed 270 children. He explains that many parents are unemployed and cannot provide food for their children. The priest also shows Estela Bravo a baby at the community center, and explains that it is the child of a 13-year-old girl. He explains that young girls seek work as domestic servants, but those jobs were increasingly difficult to obtain and some turned to prostitution. The end of the video features an interview with two doctors at the center. They explain that they treated problems of malnutrition and parasitic infections, which were caused by unsanitary living conditions and lack of clean drinking water."

It begins with footage of children sharing lunch in a school, and features shots of the streets and people in the village. The footage shows a priest speaking with people in the village, greeting them, and introducing them to Estela Bravo. Bravo asks several men and women about their country's foreign debt, and several speak about the extreme poverty in their community, the lack of jobs, and their dependence on government support. The priest shows Bravo a field fill with garbage and describes how men in the village sort the garbage and sell what they gather for parts. He explains that it is dangerous work, which contributes to many diseases in the community, and that the villagers live among the garbage daily."

The video begins with several short clips, and at minute 2:48 switches to an interview with Cuban soldiers talking about Papenfus. Minute 7:00-18:29 features an interview with Papenfus conducted by Estela Bravo. Beginning at minute 18:30 the video shows footage of Papenfus traveling back to South Africa, which makes up the bulk of the video. The video also contains short interviews with Cuban soldier Bernardo Heredia, who was held as a prisoner of war by South Africa and was one of several people exchanged for Papenfus. Two portions of the interview with Hererida begin at minute 22:15 and minute 44:32."

Estela Bravo asks about Cuba's support of Angola's war against South Africa, and the Cuban troops coming home from the war. Members of the crowd describe their understanding of the war and Cuba's reason for supporting the Angola. Many express their approval of Cuba's role in the war and speak generally about racial equality and the need to fight against apartheid in South Africa. One man discusses his reason for not volunteering to fight, and he argues with many others in the crowd. The second half of this video features an assortment of clips from footage in South Africa including a musical concert, short interviews with South Africans and Angolans, crowd footage, and Cubans who fought in Namibia. When footage is in English, Bravo speaks over the footage translating into Spanish."

The first portion features a speech to a crowd of Angolan and Cuban soldiers after the 1989 ceasefire between Angola and South Africa. The speaker is not filmed; instead footage focuses on individuals in the crowd including Fidel Castro, Angolan soldiers, and several children. The speaker praises the role of the Cuban military, the Namibian political party SWAPO, and international solidarity. After the speech Castro greets members of the crowd. At minute 16:17 the video switches to footage of equipment in an industrial yard and the construction of a truck trailer. At minute 18:49 it changes to footage of a ballet performance."

She explains that although they cannot return to their lives and families in the United State, they should try to adjust to living in Cuba as best as they can by reconnecting with family and finding work. Many of the prisoners can be seen crying and others are visibly distressed."

Austin begins by discussing the deportation process and addresses concerns about family members who were not notified when their relatives were deported back to Cuba. He also discusses and defends the policies that led to the detention of Cuban immigrants, and the type of people who the United States detained. Austin compares United States immigration policy for Cubans with its policy for other countries, and details the process by which a deported Cuban could petition to be readmitted to the United States."

The first, Pablo, speaks with McIntyre about how US prisons profited off of the government funds they received for holding Cuban excludable aliens. Later they discuss his family, and Pablo cries as he explains that he does not know if he will be able to see them again. The next interview features Orlando Sierra who describes the events that led to his detention by US immigration and the confusing legal process he went through before he was deported. He describes being arrested for several non-violent crimes in the 1980s, being detained by immigration in 1991, and not understanding why he was deported or flagged by immigration at that time."

Leshaw begins by discussing how he came to represent Cuban detainees known as \"excludables\" through the organization Atlanta Legal Aid. He talks at length about the policy of US Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) that led to the detention of these people, and his firm's attempts to obtain trails for the detainees. He later discusses attempts to end the detention of Cuban excludable aliens through legislation, but suggests that they did not have significant support from the Cuban community in the US to pass legislation in their favor. He ends the tape with a short discussion about Judge Marvin Shoob's attempts to secure due process for the detainees."

Dr. Martineau begins by describing how he became involved in treating Cuban detainees in American prisons. He describes his first experience working with detainees at the Fort Chaffee prison in Arkansas, and later at the U.S. Penitentiary in Atlanta. Martineau discusses riots by Cuban detainees in several prisons and the psychological disorders he witnessed in many of the detainees. He describes many detainees as having unclear diagnoses and unpredictable behavior, and recounts the story of one detainee who committed suicide while in custody. At the end of the interview he begins to discuss his psychiatric evaluations of detainees at Atlanta."

In the interview Martineau discusses how he started working at the Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta where he treated Cuban detainees. He discusses the people he treated and describes many of them as suffering from a wide range of mental illnesses. He describes the psychiatric ward he presided over at the prison, the reason for its creation, and the ways in which his staff diagnosed, and treated Cuban detainees. McIntyre specifically asks Martineau to speak about the use of the sedative Thorazine to subdue patients, and address complaints from former prisoners about abuses in the psychiatric ward."

They begin by discussing the legal situation of the Mariel Cubans detained in the US Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta. They discuss touring the prison and the treatment of detainees that they witnessed. They also discuss meeting Dr. Bolivar Martineau and his work in the psychiatric ward of the prison. Finally, they discuss their legal work and constitutionality of the detention of the Cuban refugees. At minute 11:30 the video changes to an interview with Atlanta Legal Aid attorney Gary Leshaw. He describes his organization's attempts to secure trials for Cuban detainees and talks at length about the Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) policy that led to the detention of the Cubans."

The official interview begins around minute 3:00 and features a discussion about Cubans who were detained by Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS), and the difficulty of obtaining individual trials for these people. He shares a story about a man who he argued never should have been detained by INS, but was held in a US prison for several years because of what he describes as an arbitrary decision and a failure to individually address his case. Shoob also discusses his attempts to gain the release of several detainees and the resistance he encountered from the federal government and prison administrators."

Finally, he describes conditions detainees faced in American prisons, which led some detainees to suicide or self-harm."

The interview begins with a discussion of the events that led to the Mariel Boatlift in 1980. Smith cites Cuban attempts to establish normalized immigration policies with the United States, hijackings of Cuban boats by individuals seeking to reach the US, and the occupation of the Peruvian embassy in Cuba in 1980. He talks at length about the legal status of the Mariel Cubans who were listed as excludable, and others who were paroled into the country upon arrival. He also discusses the unique situation of Mariel, and the human rights abuses that many Mariel Cubans faced after they were detained by US immigration."

The interview begins with a discussion of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba, tensions that led to the crisis of the Mariel Boatlift, and the excludable immigrants that arrived in the United States among that group. Smith discusses diplomatic talks between Cuba and the United States that took place under the administration of Jimmy Carter, but were stalled after Ronald Reagan took office. He talks about this history of US immigration policy toward Cuba and expresses his hope that the incoming Clinton administration will normalize relations. The last 10 minutes of the video focus on interviewer Linden McIntyre and feature him restating questions to make them more succinct for the edited film."

Of particular interest are interviews with Dr. Bolivar Martineau, deputy warden and chief medical officer at the Atlanta Penitentiary where detainees were held. Interviews with Dr. Bolivar Martineau and Denny McLain were arranged and funded by 5th Estate Canadian Broadcasting System who used the footage for a period of time and then turned it over to the Bravos for their film.",

Some of the material is duplicative and there is large amount of background footage and shots of leaving and arriving planes."

They explain that the boy's mother had taken him from Cuba to Peru because she believed that he would get better medical care there. The doctors, however, explain that the boy has a complicated heart condition that they cannot treat. They discuss Peru's limited medical resources, and the need to send patients with more complicated medical issues to hospitals and clinics in Brazil. They explain they are only able to offer palliative care to the boy, and that he will need to go to another hospital for surgery."

                                                "This video features an interview with baseball player Hank Aaron. At the beginning, Aaron briefly introduces himself and discusses his baseball career. The bulk of the interview focuses on Aaron's impression of Cuba and Fidel Castro. Aaron describes traveling to Cuba to film a documentary about Cuban baseball players, and describes the quality of education and baseball training he observed while in Cuba. He also discusses meeting Fidel Castro, and speaks specifically about Castro's athletic ability. Aaron also talks briefly about the poor diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States, and argues that lack of trade and freedom of movement between the countries has contributed to the suffering of Cuban people and their family members in the United States."

In this portion, Alarcón addresses Estela Bravo's questions about criticism of Cuba's lack of free press by comparing Cuba's press with privately owned newspapers in the United States. He criticizes the United States electoral system, which he contrasts with Cuban local elections. In the second half of the interview he talks about Cuba's role in Latin America, discussing both support for the Cuban government and opposition from what he describes as counter-revolutionary movements. He also talks about the significance of Fidel Castro's beard and his predictions for Cuba's future after Castro's presidency."

In this brief segment, Alarcón discusses Fidel Castro's personal appearance as a symbol of the revolution, the numerous assassination attempts made against Castro over the years, and the reasons many powerful people have expressed interest in meeting him. At minute 12:42 the footage changes to an interview with Castro's translator Juanita Vera García. García discusses how she became Castro's translator, and talks about what it is like to travel with Castro and act as interpreter for some of his long public speeches."

Later a prominent figure in the Communist Party of Cuba, Almeida was, at the time of his death, Vice-President of the Cuban Council of State and its third ranking member."

The interview begins with an anecdote about Belafonte bringing Fidel Castro a gift of cheese, and the caution with which Castro's body guards viewed the gift in light of the numerous assassination attempts that have been made against Castro. The bulk of the interview focuses on Belafonte's travels to Cuba with his family. He discusses his musical performances, and his children's enjoyment of Cuban culture. Robinson discusses bringing her parents to Cuba, and their request to be buried there after they died."

Bourne begins with a lengthy discussion about the custody struggle over Elián González and the United States decision to return him to Cuba. He talks about the ways in which the struggle shifted Americans' perceptions of both Cuba and the exile community in Miami. The conversation then shifts to a general discussion about the way American opinions about Cuba are shaped by the press, which Bourne contrasts with that of other Latin American countries. The second part of the interview focuses on human rights in Cuba, healthcare, and education. He also briefly discusses why some Cubans have left the country, the Cuban economy, and the waning support Cuba received from the Soviet Union beginning in the 1980s."

Bourne describes Castro as an elder statesman among nationalist leaders in developing nations, and discusses his image as a role model for other young leaders. He then turns to a discussion about Castro's meeting with Pope John Paul II, describing the dynamic between the two men and the motivations behind the meeting. Bourne speaks about Castro's leadership in Cuba addressing concerns about human rights, and Castro's role as a leader in the post-colonial era. He ends with a brief discussion about the history of American influence in Cuba and his expectations for Cuba's fate after the United States lifts the trade embargo and after Castro leaves office."

Bourne restates several of the same points in an attempt to provide fluidity for segments used in Bravo's documentary. He begins by discussing Castro's relationship with his first wife Mirta Díaz-Balart and their son Fidelito. He also discusses Fidel's relationship with Celia Sanchez and the important role she played in his life. He then changes to a discussion about the immediate aftermath of the Cuban revolution, discussing why people decided to leave, the trials of former Batista government officials, and the development of contentious diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba. Bourne ends with several short discussions about Castro's relationship with leaders in Vietnam, Chile, Nicaragua, and Grenada."

In the second half of the interview Bourne discusses Cuban elections, and the medical training Cuba provides to students in Latin America."

Bourne begins by talking about Castro's childhood and relationship with his parents. He also discusses Castro's experience at the University of Havana, and describes corruption at Cuban universities during that era. He discusses the ways in which Castro's upbringing influenced his political ideology, specifically citing his mother's Christianity. Later in the interview Bourne describes the influential women in Castro's life including Mirta Díaz-Balart, to whom he was married for 2 years, and his long-time partner Celia Sanchez. Bourne also talks at length about Castro's character and the impression he makes on the people who meet him. This interview was recorded in London and was not conducted by Estela Bravo, but rather an unidentified man who speaks off camera."

Bourne begins by speaking about the aftermath of the Cuban revolution specifically addressing the refugees and the trials of individuals connected to the Batista government. He also discusses Cuba's support of revolutions in Latin America, Castro's relationship with Maurice Bishop, the custody battle over Elián González, Cuban healthcare, Castro's views on globalization, and restrictions on freedom of speech. At minute 25:00 the video changes to footage of an auction featuring cigar boxes signed by Castro and dated March 3, 2000. At minute 27:35 footage changes to an event calling for the return of Elián González. The event features González's father Juan González Quintana, his grandmothers, and groups of school children performing Cuban songs and dances."

He discusses Castro's first wife Mirta Díaz-Balart, and Castro's political activism prior to the revolution. The bulk of the interview focuses on Castellanos work representing Castro, and the other revolutionaries who were arrested after their attack on the Moncada Barracks. He discusses speaking with Díaz-Balart following the attack, and his legal representation of Raúl Castro prior to Fidel's capture. He also discusses the role of Marta Rojas who reported on the trials of the rebels captured at Moncada. At minute 22:44 Castellanos looks through photographs he saved from that period, and an image of Raúl Castro can be seen at the top of the stack. The video quality at the end of the recording is poor."

Castro contends that she does not believe Revuelta is her brother's daughter, but notes that he has never denied paternity. She also discusses her sister Juana Castro, who opposed her brother's politics and moved to the United States. Later in the interview Castro speaks about the impact the Cuban Revolution had on her life and her experience of having Fidel Castro as both a brother and a president. She also addresses criticism that her children received preferential treatment because Castro was their uncle."

                                                "In this interview Estela Bravo asks Marshall Frady about people's criticism of Fidel Castro for human rights abuses in Cuba. Frady argues that many of the negative reactions against Castro were formed during the Cold War, and that much of the antipathy directed at Castro formed as a result of decades of poor diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States. The bulk of the interview focuses on popular perceptions of Fidel Castro, in which Frady describes him as a figure that inspired passionate reactions, both positive and negative. The interview is in English."

The video begins with footage of images in Fusté's office and an interview that starts at minute 5:30. Fusté begins by speculating about end of the Castro presidency, which he predicts will occur within a year of the time in which the interview was conducted. He also talks about his family members still living in Cuba, and the state of the country. He discusses Cuban exiles who have attempted to reach the US by raft or in the Mariel Boatlift, and blames Castro for the tragedies that had have happened as a result of people fleeing the country. Finally, Fusté discusses other anti-Castro Cubans in the United States including Orlando Bosch and Jorge Mas Canosa."

The brief footage focuses on a photograph from the event. At minute 3:35 the video changes to an interview with Manuel González Corrales. He discusses his memories of Fidel Castro at the University of Havana and their shared involvement in student activism. He describes the political environment within the university as a microcosm and training ground for the revolutionary movements that developed in Cuba, and later discusses the assassination of Student Federation leader Manolo Castro."

She then discusses Castro asking her to write a prolog for a book about her father, Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, and his role supporting the unsuccessful revolution in Congo. She describes her enjoyment writing the prolog because it allowed her to revisit positive memories of her father. She also describes Castro's relationship with Guevara, and how Castro convinced him to return to Cuba briefly before he left to support guerilla forces in Bolivia. In the last half of the interview, she reads from the letter Castro wrote to her father convincing him to return to Cuba."

Leal discusses the relationship between Fidel Castro and his brother Raúl, which he describes as one of extreme confidence and closeness. Leal also describes the relationship between Castro and other prominent individuals in Cuba including Che Guevara, Celia Sanchez, Carlos Rafael Rodríguez, Conchita Fernandez, and Baudillo Castellano. Finally, he discusses Castro as a polarizing figure and talks about the opposition of many Cubans to his leadership. The last two minutes of the video feature background footage of Leal walking through a courtyard."

Lesnik begins by discussing student activism at the University of Havana and clashes with Fulgencio Batista's government. He later discusses Fidel Castro's relationship with his first wife Mirta Díaz-Balart. He later describes Fidel's interest weapons and military action, and describes how the beginnings of Castro's coalition grew out of a militant faction he developed within the Partido Ortodoxo (Orthodox Party). Lesnik details Castro's personality as a young man and suggests that peers viewed him as audacious and likely to achieve prominence. He later addresses a question about racism and notes that as a Jewish man he did face some racism in Cuba, but argues that the generation that he and Castro were a part of held much less prejudice."

He discusses what Castro was like as a student and an athlete, and describes him as particularly diligent.

                                                "In this portion of an interview the Father Armando Llorente, Llorente shares anecdotes about Fidel Castro when he was a student at el Colegio Belen. He first shares a story about a time Castro saved him while they were trying to cross a flooding river during a school camping trip. He then talks about an incident when Castro was almost expelled because he refused reveal the location of two missing classmates to the school's rector. Llorente explains that the students had left school in the immediate aftermath of Pearl Harbor to volunteer to fight in World War II, and Castro had promised to keep their decision secret. Finally, he looks through a yearbook from Colegio Belen, and points out a description about Castro in the yearbook."

Menchu discusses the way people in the third world and Latin America view Fidel Castro, and explains that many see him as a symbol of resistance against imperialism.

She explains that although political and business leaders largely oppose his presidency, opinions about Castro, even in the United States, are very diverse."

He describes his early interest in sports journalism, and later becoming interested in politics after meeting exiled Brazilian youth living in Italy. He describes traveling to Brazil with friends and meeting Latin American intellectuals including Gabriel García Márquez. He later discusses an attempt to interview Fidel Castro at a boxing match in Monaco. He describes interviewing Castro 13 years after his initial attempt, and credits Márquez with facilitating the interview. He describes his interview with Castro in which they discussed Cuban human rights, scientific research, and the death of Che Guevara. The video contains frequent background noise, which makes some of the interview difficult to hear in places."

Mina explains that Castro only discussed his professional relationship with Guevara, and notes that Castro expressed his disagreement with Guevara's decisions to support revolutionary movements in the third world.

The second half of the interview focuses on Castro's meeting with Pope John Paul II. Mina discusses the reasons he thought the two men sought the meeting, and what each gained from the encounter. The video ends with a discussion about the role of the Catholic church in Latin America."

Ordóñez describes his admiration for Raúl. He also talks about the ways in which Raúl and Fidel Castro complimented each other, contending that Raúl had a skill for organization and Fidel a skill for strategy. He also briefly discusses Celia Sanchez and her support of public health. He discusses his perceptions of Fidel Castro as a man, and describes his relationship with Castro at el Colegio de Belén. He discusses his decision to stay in Cuba after the revolution despite the fact that many of his family members fled the country. Video quality is poor in several places."

He argues that what Cuba needs most is not internal political reform, but rather a change in the United States foreign policy toward Cuba. He argues that the United States needs to respect Cuban sovereignty by lifting the blockade and improving diplomatic relations with the Cuban government. Ortega states that he does not think Castro believes in Communism, but rather adopted the political structure in opposition to the United States. He suggests that by aligning with the Soviet Union Castro hoped avoid a US funded coup similar to the overthrow of Jacobo Árbenz in Guatemala. At the end of the interview he discusses his writing career and how his opinions toward Cuba have changed over the years."

Ortega speaks primarily about Cuban exiles in Miami and the strong anti-Castro sentiment that exists in the city. He discusses US policy toward Cuba, criticizing aggressive US foreign policy and the trade embargo. He also discusses criticism of Cuba for political repression and its single party system, and the US government's response to human rights concerns in Cuba compared to other countries. Much of the second half of the interview focuses on the case of Elián González and the Miami Cuban community's attempt to stop his return to Cuba."

The interview with Ortega begins where the footage from tape ref227 ends and runs until minute 16:30. In this portion of the interview he discusses the Cuban community in Miami, and the polarized opinions about Fidel Castro that the community holds. He also talks about the custody battle over Elián González and the image of Fidel Castro as a figure of anti-imperialism in Latin American. At minute 16:31 the footage changes to an interview with Max Lesnik. Lesnik describes his acquaintance with Castro at the University of Havana, where they were classmates. Lesnik discusses Castro's politics during that era, and the inspiration Castro drew from the political leader Eduardo Chibás and the writings of José Martí. The video quality is poor during portions of this interview."

Sheinbaum talks about meeting Fidel Castro and his impression of Castro as a political leader, which he contrasts with his experience meeting Syrian leader Bashar al Assad. Filmed sometime between 1995 and 1996, Sheinbaum discusses the passage of the Helm-Burton Act by the US Congress, and speculates about impact of the upcoming 1996 elections on US policy toward Cuba. He addresses the criticism and admiration of Castro, and compares Castro's government with Cuba under the presidency of Fulgencio Batista. He also discusses a potential meeting between Castro and President Bill Clinton, but suggests that such a meeting would be contingent on the political situation in the United States. The end of the interview features still images of Sheinbaum with both Castro and Clinton."

The interview with Smith features a discussion about his memories of Cuba prior to the Cuban Revolution, and the changes that followed. He discusses Castro's role as a leader, speaking specifically about the nationalization of US properties in Cuba and failed negotiations between the two countries. He also discusses the controversy over Elián González and criticism of human rights violations in Cuba. At minute 30:35 the video switches to footage of a parade for the Premio Internacional Benito Juárez. The bulk features on-the-street footage of the parade, while the last 5 minutes feature a performance from a children's choir."

He suggests that anti-Fidelistas are still the majority in Miami, but those in favor of Castro are increasing. He addresses criticism of Castro as a dictator, and contends that he does not consider dictators frightening. He also discusses returning to Cuba in 1993. He describes meeting Castro again, and describes their meeting as amiable. In the second half of the interview Estela Bravo shares a yearbook from Colegio de Belén during the years when he was a teacher of Fidel Castro. Varela looks through the yearbook and shares stories about students and his memories at the school."

Walker begins with a discussion about Cuban education and efforts to spread literacy to the elderly. She also discusses her impressions of Cuba during various visits she took to the island. She discusses her first visit in 1978, and explains that she was dismayed by how many white men held positions of power and the government's treatment of gays. She later discusses meeting Fidel Castro on subsequent trips to Cuba with delegations brining medical supplies."

Walker discusses her memories of Castro's 1995 speech at Riverside Church in Harlem, and her experience meeting Castro in person. She addresses American media portrayals of Castro as a dictator, which she says contrasts with her perception of him. Walker also discusses Castro's knowledge of agricultural issues, and concludes that his longevity as a leader in Cuba comes from the support he has from many Cuban citizens. The end of the video features still images of Walker with Castro and during her travels in Cuba."

This lengthy footage consists primarily of Castro speaking about a variety of subjects. It also features footage of news photographers, including Estela Bravo, to whom he appears to be speaking. He talks about his recent trip to the United States, describes an event where Yasser Arafat was asked to leave Lincoln Center, and talks about how he would have reacted if he been asked to leave. As the footage progresses, it is possible to see the progress of the portrait."

The majority of the clips feature rallies and town meetings in Cuba calling for the return of Elian González. Castro does not speak in any of the clips, but can be seen greeting crowds. In one section he speaks to González's father Juan Miguel González Quintana, but cannot be heard due to poor audio quality. Other clips feature Castro touring a Cuban medical school with American reporter Andrea Mitchell, and clips included at the end of the tape feature Castro greeting crowds during his travels to other countries."

                                                "This video features the first portion of a speech by Fidel Castro to the South African parliament in Cape Town, South Africa. Castro begins speaking around minute 5:00. He begins by offering his support and hope for the creation of a new South Africa led by Nelson Mandela, and commends Mandela for his commitment to justice following the end of the apartheid system. Castro calls for an end to divisions on the basis of race, and encourages South Africa and its political leaders to seek to address problems in economic inequality. He discusses the history of colonialism, which led to slavery and exploitation across the globe, expresses his hope that the new South African government will serve as an example of how to break free from the legacy of that system.

The video begins with footage of Mandela arriving in Cuba where he is greeted by Fidel Castro.

Much of the audio captured in these clips features informal discussions between the two leaders as they  travel to different venues. Footage at the end of the video features Fidel Castro during a visit to South Africa, and ends with a segment of footage shot sometime earlier in which Mandela asks Castro to visit South Africa."

The footage focuses predominantly on individuals and their reactions to Castro's speech.

The video starts and stops several times and as a result does not contain a complete recording of Castro's speech."

The bulk of the video features footage of the crowd waiting for Castro's arrival. At minute 1:55 Estela Bravo briefly interviews Bronx Congressman Jose Serrano about his opinions of Castro and the reason the crowd at the church is eager to hear him speak. At minute 10:16 the footage changes to an interview with an American diplomat who was part of the negotiations to return Elian González to Cuba. She talks about Castro as a negotiator and her perceptions of working with him on the González case. The footage also shows Fidel Castro arriving at the church and brief welcoming statements from various speakers."

Finally, he talks at length about what he viewed as overblown news coverage of his handshake with American President Bill Clinton, explaining that it lasted only a brief moment and the two men were simply trying to be polite."

Co-author of the bill, Representative Dan Burton from Indiana speaks next and outlines the provisions of the bill, which places restrictions on U.S. trading partners who seek to trade with Cuba.

It contains an assortment of clips including: Castro meeting Latin American presidents; Gabriel García Márquez and his wife Mercedes; Castro speaking about inequality and justice; footage of Robert McNamara, Castro, and Jorge Risquet joking with each other around 00:27:00; a speech by Castro; and a celebration of Castro's birthday on plane. At 00:38:00 there is footage of a meeting in preparation for Pope's visit to Cuba. In another clip, Castro shows a set of Russian dolls and boxing puppets of himself and Bill Clinton, and around 00:56:00 there is a clip of a visit by Mohammed Ali and the Cuban boxer, Teofilo Stevenson. The sound drops out in intermittently throughout the video."

The footage that follows includes grainy clips of Havana after Batista fled Cuba and several shots of tourists leaving the country. These clips are mostly black and white and in some places there is no sound. Most are in Spanish, but there is a small amount of narration in English. There are also shots of enthusiastic crowds as Castro and his entourage travel through the countryside and into Havana. Some footage appears to have been shot in Harlem during Fidel's visit to the United Nations."

The beginning of the video begins with representatives entering the chamber and welcoming Castro. Portions of this speech are duplicated on the video ref150.

After minute 41:00 Castro continues speaking about the potential of African youth and stresses Cuba's history of solidarity with African nations and the third world. He addresses challenges facing Africa like deforestation, desertification, and HIV/AIDS. The end of the video focuses on speculative investment and the United States economy, in which Castro criticizes the US for artificially inflating its currency.

The footage largely consists of shots of the crowd chanting \" Cuba Sí, Bloqueo No,\" and some notable individuals can be seen in the crowd including Angela Davis and Ricardo Alarcón. The video contains several segments of speakers welcoming Castro to Harlem, but much of the footage of the speakers is cut short. The end of the recording shows Castro leaving the church and greeting the crowd."

The footage begins part-way through Castro's speech. He describes his decision to wear his military fatigues in Harlem, the unwelcoming reception he received from New York's political leaders, and the need to end the blockade on Cuba. He also talks about Cuba's support of independence struggles in Angola and South Africa, and the United Nations lack of recognition for their support. After Castro's speech concludes, footage shows him leaving the church and greeting members of the crowd."

It begins by describing the political and economic climate of Cuba prior to the revolution. The program then details events of the revolution, including the siege on the Moncada barracks, Castro's invasion from Mexico, and the revolutionaries in the Sierra Maestra. It then discusses Cuban life and government after the revolution, and describes events leading up to the Bay of Pigs invasion. The program is narrated in English, but is told from a Cuban perspective. The video does not contain a complete version of the program and starts and stops in various places."

The beginning of the video features Castro speaking with Guayasamín in his studio as he works on a portrait of Castro. Subsequent footage features Castro speaking with several individuals, including Estela Bravo, about food and cooking in the kitchen of Guayasamín's home. The bulk of the footage, beginning at minute 33:00, features Fidel speaking to the group about religion, nationalism, and the market economy. He talks in particular about Catholicism and his perception of religion as a vehicle to acquire power. Castro also discusses his memories of the events of the Cuban Revolution."

The first clip includes on-the-street footage of overcrowded buses in Havana, and people waiting in long bus lines. The clips show footage of people on bicycles, and a few cars driving by on the streets. At minute 6:10 the video switches to footage of Fidel Castro on a visit to Vietnam. This footage does not have any sound, but shows Castro meeting state leaders and shaking hands with groups of people. At minute 7:41 the tape switches to older black and white footage of a hurricane and rescue efforts to help Cuban communities affected by flooding and storm damage."

The first clip briefly shows footage of Elián González receiving a book signed by Fidel Castro, the second features Castro walking in a parade, and the next features part of a speech by US Representative Maxine Waters welcoming Castro to New York City. At minute 7:28 the video switches to footage of an interview with Arthur Strimling. In the interview, Strimling talks about watching Castro speak in Harlem in 1959. He describes the crowds who gathered to see Castro and the reception Castro received from the media and political leaders. Strimling also talks about how his views on Castro changed over the years. He explains that although he has admiration for the economic revolution in Cuba, he is troubled by the country's human rights abuses and repression of political opposition."

In these interviews Estela Bravo asks people what they think the future holds for Cuba. She specifically asks if they think Cuba will remain a socialist country, and whether they believe the Cuban government will retain power after Fidel Castro's leadership ends. The majority express their belief that Cuban government will remain intact. Individuals on the street also discuss their opinions about the Cuba socialism, and the reasons they have stayed in the country when many others have left."

Because so much of the interview footage for \u003cspan class=\"emph emph-italic\"\u003eFidel: The Untold Story\u003c/span\u003e could not be included in the initial feature-length film, Estela and Ernesto Bravo made a follow-up documentary, \u003cspan class=\"emph emph-italic\"\u003eAnecdotes about Fidel\u003c/span\u003e, in 2010.

The mother and daughter discuss their reasons for supporting the flotilla and express their frustration at the people opposing it. They criticize the United States embargo against Cuba, and contend the that flotilla is a matter of human rights not politics. The video then shows footage of people loading a boat with supplies. At minute 14:10, Bravo interviews a group of people opposing the flotilla who argue that the goods will be taken by the Cuban government and sold to tourists. They express their doubt that the Cuban people will receive the goods, and instead express their fear that Castro will use the aid to control the people."

It begins with an interview with the crew of one of the boats who talk about the rough waters on their journey across the Strait of Florida. The footage then changes to a larger ship of supplies being unloaded onto a Red Cross truck. It features an interview with one of the Red Cross organizers as well as an organizer from the Key West-based group Basta. The end of video features a second interview with the spokesman from Basta at a children's hospital where many of the supplies were delivered. He explains that the purpose of the event at the hospital is to prove that the supplies are being delivered directly to the people."

Also documented are the activities of many of the anti-Castro groups in Florida and in New Jersey who violently opposed travel between the United States and Cuba. Appearing in the film are US politicians including Republican Senator and former Representative from Arizona Jeff Flake; Republican former Senator and Representative from Idaho, Larry Craig; Democratic former Representative from Massachusetts, Bill Delahunt; and Democratic Massachusetts Representative, Jim McGovern. In the documentary they contend that travel between the countries builds openness and understanding; strengthens family ties; fosters cultural exchange, tourism and trade; and is a constitutional right for all Americans. No raw footage associated with the film is available. Only a completed version of the documentary is included in this series."

The first several minutes feature children drawing doves and other tributes to Quintana on the street. At minute 2:58 the video changes to an interview with Quintana. She discusses her hope of meeting with the Pope, and her surprise at the warm welcome she received upon her return. She says that she hopes to continue fighting and speaking out against the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, but acknowledges that protest is still very difficult. She also discusses a button featuring the Rodrigo Andres Rojas de Negri, who died when they were both attacked by members of the Chilean military and burned. She explains that she hopes to be a representative of Rojas's memory. At minute 10:56 the footage changes to Chilean youths discussing a mural of Quintana and Rojas, painted at the location where they were attacked. A young woman and young man speak with Bravo about the significance of Quintana and Rojas to the youth movement in Chile."

The footage shows protestors building makeshift barriers and throwing objects while police try to disperse them. The footage focuses primarily on the crowd, and does not show the Pope speaking, although he can be heard through a loudspeaker. The video features several on-the-street interviews: one with a man opposed to the protests, one with a local journalist, and one with a young protester. The end of this video also features an interview with exiled Chilean Socialist leader Clodomiro Almeyda. In the interview Almeyda discusses why he chose to return to Chile during the Pope's visit to the country."

Estela Bravo asks the students, who are from middle and upper-class schools, about their opinions of Chilean President Augusto Pinochet, Pope John Paul II's visit, and the attack on Carmen Gloria Quintana. Students from the various groups express different opinions on these topics, and many of the students who come from upper-class households express their support of Pinochet. They argue that the people protesting his government are mistaken and supporters of terrorism. Several students express their admiration for Pinochet, and contend that he saved the country from communism. Other students express their dislike of Pinochet, and contend that the students who support him are uninformed and are not in a position to understand the political situation of the country."

The first few seconds of the video contain footage of the grave of Chilean dissident Rodrigo Andres Rojas de Negri. It quickly changes to an interview with Letelier, which begins with a discussion about his early life and his father's assassination. He discusses leaving Chile when he was 3 years old, and returning to Chile later in life. He also talks about his involvement in leftist political movements in Chile and his participations in Chile's Socialist Youth. He discusses the significance of the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1987, and the 1989 general elections. Letelier talks at length about the political climate in Chile at the end of the 1980s discussing the country's transition to democracy and the influence of youth activism. The video quality is poor in many places."

They discuss their involvement in the resistance movement against the Pinochet government and the violence they have witnessed in the country. The interview focuses on the government's use of torture against citizens. The woman shares specific examples of torture used against Chilean citizens, discuss police interrogation methods, and describes the psychological effects of state-sponsored violence. At minute 12:00 the video features a demonstration against the government, and protestors can be seen clashing briefly with the police. Bravo interviews members of the crowd about why they are at the protest, and about their expectations for the upcoming 1987 visit of Pope John Paul II."

It then changes to shots of newspaper headlines announcing the arrival of socialist politician Clodomiro Almeyda. At minute 9:29 the footage changes to edits of a CNN Atlanta news report on the political climate in Chile. The footage features several segments which focus on a failed national strike, the death of journalist José Carrasco, and the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. After the CNN report ends the video features additional raw footage of protests, funerals, government events, and a short speech by Pinochet denouncing communists in the country. The end of the video features footage of an impoverished community."

It traces the story of Carmen Gloria Quintana and her 1987 journey back to Chile to see the Pope. In addition to footage of the Pope's visit and the ongoing protests the documentary includes interviews with Quintana and many others. Among the voices captured are those of elites, particularly young people, who supported the Pinochet government and felt the protests were unnecessary. Footage in this series includes shots of Quintana touring Chile, speeches by the Pope, interviews with Quintana and other Chileans, and historical footage contextualizing Chilean politics."

                                        "Carmen Gloria Quintana Arancibia (1968- ) is a Chilean woman who became a symbol of hope for democracy in Chile to many Chileans after she received an embrace and encouragement from Pope John Paul II in 1987.\nOn July 2,1986, Quintana, along with a young photographer, Rodrigo Andres Rojas de Negri, were participating in a student protest in Santiago. They were attacked and beaten by a patrol of military police, soaked with gasoline, and set on fire. De Negri died of his burns. Gloria suffered second and third degree burns over 62% of her body; she was critically ill and was moved to a hospital in Canada. Although she survived, Gloria was badly disfigured from her burns. When the Pope visited Chile in 1987, she returned and was able to meet with the pontiff in Santiago."

He then talks about his 10-year imprisonment in Uruguay by the country's military dictatorship. He describes Uruguay's transition to democracy and the influence of the country's foreign debt on that process. He explains that he is optimistic about the transition to democracy, but contends that the process has just begun and that the country has a long history of repression and disappearance of political dissidents that needs to be addressed. At the end of the interview he expresses his gratitude to Castro and Cuba for supporting the Communist Party in Uruguay and its fight against the military dictatorship."

Estela Bravo speaks with them, in Spanish, about various topics including the Reagan administration and the experience of the Spanish-speaking population in New York.  They are very critical of Reagan and his policies, which they call \"anti-Latin.\" They talk about the economic recession in the United States, lack of representation, lack of support for poor communities, and the difficulty of uniting Latin Americans in the United States because they come from so many different countries. They address other concerns, including the difficulty of organizing for more rights because they are too busy working at low wage jobs. Bravo asks their opinions about American policies on Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Honduras. They also discuss how the United States addresses problems such as drug addiction and violence."

As a result, the Cuban government announced that anyone who wanted to leave the country could do so. In a joint agreement between the United States and Cuba, some 125,000 refugees left the Cuban port of Mariel bound for the United States in what came to be known as the Mariel Boatlift. Cubans who traveled to the US as part of the boatlift came to be known as Marielitos.",

Beginning at minute 4:00 the footage switches to an interview with three young Namibians. The interview was recorded on the first day of Namibian independence in 1990, and the students discuss their excitement for the new government and eagerness to participate in the political process. The three students, all of whom received part of their education in Cuba, talk about their experiences studying in Cuba and the ways they hope to use their educations. They also talk briefly about continued racism in Namibia between white and black communities, and feeling removed from their country after studying abroad for several years."

This portion is barely audible and audio and video quality is poor throughout. The majority of the video focuses on footage of father Brian O. Walsh who facilitated the transportation of Cuban children to the United States during Operation Peter Pan. A young man watches the footage and describes what his experience as one of the Peter Pan children and his memories of his life in the United States. He discusses traveling to the U.S. at the age of 12 and later deciding to return to Cuba. He explains that he eventually returned to Cuba in 1971, but that the process was difficult."

Walsh begins by discussing the children currently in the care of his Catholic organization in Miami. At the time of the interview Walsh explained that he was caring for 25 children between the ages of 14 and 18. He describes the motivation of many Cuban parents who decided to send their children to the United States in the early 1960s, explaining that many feared their children would be sent to Russia for communist indoctrination. He also discusses his organization's role in clandestine efforts to send Cuban children the US, and explains that parents expected Castro would be overthrown and their children would quickly return. He later discusses children who had a difficult time adjusting to life in the US, and the Miami-based youth organization the Antonio Maceo Brigade, which was outspoken in its support of the Cuban government."

                                        "In 1960, rumors circulated Cuba that the new revolutionary government planned to suspend parental authority and enroll the children in military schools or send them to Russia for Communist indoctrination. In the wake of the rumors, Cuban parents sent as many as 14,000 unaccompanied children on flights out of Cuba between 1960 and 1962. The United States government facilitated this mass exodus of Cuban children, which became popularly known as Operation Peter Pan, through a clandestine program that waived the children's visa requirements and provided several million dollars to the Miami Catholic Welfare Bureau to care for the children. Many parents expected to be reunited with their children after what they believed would be the swift fall communist government. Following the Bay of Pigs invasions in 1962, however, US-Cuba relations deteriorated, and permanently separated many parents and children. Some children were able to connect with family members in the United States, but approximately 7000 were moved into long-term orphanages or foster care.",

                                                "This video features a speech by Augusto Pinochet delivered on September 11, the anniversary of the military coup in which he seized power in Chile. In his speech, Pinochet contends that Chile must continue to fight against communism and Marxism. He discusses the history of communism and argues that Chile must stay vigilant because the goal of communism is to take over the world. He contends that his government is protecting democracy, and argues that if critics understood the threat that Chile faced they would know that his actions were correct. The second half of this video features footage of a Cuban dramatic television program filmed by Estela Bravo."

Godoy's mother begins by discussing the youth movement in Chile and the reasons Chilean youth have expressed such strong resistance to the Pinochet government. At the time of the interview, which was filmed sometime around 1985, she explains that the children have lived under Pinochet for 12 years and many remember their family members disappearing or going into exile, and cannot see a future for themselves under the current government. She expresses her hope in the community and her faith that the government will eventually change. The video then focuses on news reports and photos of Carols Godoy and his murder. At minute 17:55 the videos changes to an interview with the executive secretary of the foundation Protection of Youth Damaged by State of Emergency (PIDEE), which helped children whose parents had been harmed, detained, or disappeared by the government. She describes the foundation, its goals, and the kind of support it provides to the children whose families were targeted for political reasons."

At the beginning of the video police can be see chasing demonstrators outside of the cemetery. The video then features an interview with the mother of Carlos Godoy at his grave. Godoy's mother talks about her son, and his murder, and describes him as emblematic of many Chilean youth. After the interview with Godoy's mother, a man speaks about the memory of Godoy and the importance of continued resistance against Augusto Pinochet in Chile."

This documentary explores the experience of youth who returned to Chile without their parents after living in exile for many years.  Several of the youths featured in the documentary discuss their difficulty adjusting to life in Chile and struggles with identity. A portion of the film focuses on Carlos Godoy Echegoyen, a twenty-three-year-old Socialist who died under torture in a police station in the port of Quintero in February 1985, shortly after returning from exile. Bravo interviews his mother and his sister. It also features scenes in a cemetery at Godoy's grave and the graves of others, including Victor Jara, and Salvador Allende. The film also tells the story of three children from one family whose parents were taken and who must fend for themselves.",

Footage features cemetery scenes, discussions about Carlos Godoy, Chilean religious and social welfare groups, speeches by Pinochet, and other background scenes. "

Most of the exiles were either supporters of former president Salvador Allende or activists on the political left who feared abuse under the new government. Exiles were barred from returning for many years, but by 1984 the Chilean government agreed to grant most of the exiles permission to return home. This opening was spurred by international pressure and a domestic campaign to abolish restrictions on exiles. ",

Silvio Rodriguez and Pablo Milanes, two of Cuba's most popular composer-singer-musicians, organized the concert, which featured some of the best Argentine folk musicians at that time. The documentary shows the enthusiastic response of the Argentine people, as the musicians perform songs that had previously been prohibited in Argentina. This series contains footage of Rodriguez and Milanes in Argentina, as well as some footage of the performers at a concert in the Bronx."

The footage features a series of on-the-street interviews conducted by Estela Bravo in Union City, New Jersey in which she asks the men why they traveled to the United States and what they hoped to find. The majority of the men interviewed were living in the United States for less than a year at the time the interviews were conducted. Many mention that they left Cuba because they did not agree with the communist government. Others explain that they left to find better work and earn money although several mention that they have had a difficult time finding work in the United States. They likewise describe finding it difficult to get adequate housing and access to medical care. One man notes that he has received little support from the existing Cuban community in the US, and has received more support from other immigrant groups including Puerto Ricans and Dominicans. Some of the men mention travelling to the US as part of the Mariel Boatlift. The term \"escoria\" refers to a statement made by Fidel Castro about Cuban exiles, comparing those who left to escoria (scum)."

In the documentary, Estela Bravo sheds light on major events in the history of US-Cuba relations including Operation Peter Pan and the Mariel Boatlift. The documentary also features interviews with Cuban Americans in favor of normalizing relations between the United States and Cuba, and others who support the overthrow of the communist government in Cuba. This series contains interviews with individuals featured in the documentary, footage of immigration workers, and incomplete portions of the documentary, and an early version of the film, which was originally called \u003cspan class=\"emph emph-italic\"\u003eEl Dialogo\u003c/span\u003e."

They did not tell anyone about their journey, and after a few months of living in the United States, they asked to Cuba's representatives in the United States for permission to return. They were finally able to return to Cuba, and upon their arrival, they share their experiences with relatives who knew nothing of their travels to the United States. Footage from this documentary includes scenes from the three rafters' arrival in Cuba and possibly a full-length copy of the film."

The first interview features the widow of Cuban pacifist Luciano Nieves. She discusses her husband's assassination, and describes him as a pioneer for calling for improved relations between the US and Cuba in the 1970s. The second interview features anti-Castro political activist Felipe Rivero. Rivero discusses his involvement in the Bay of Pigs invasion and addresses criticism about members of his movement who have been charged with or convicted of terrorism. He specifically discusses members of his organization who were convicted for the assassination of Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier. The third interview features Miami priest Father Bryan Walsh. Walsh discusses his role in sponsoring Cuban children traveling to the US without their parents between 1960 and 1962, and the US government's role in supporting that work. The final 30 minutes to the tape feature assorted clips recorded from television. Video and audio quality is very poor and the bulk of the content on the second half of this tape is difficult to view."

The neighbor begins by explaining that the children were abandoned by their mother in 1980, when she left Cuba for the United States in the Mariel Boatlift. The eldest daughter explains that she was 11 years old at the time, and she and her siblings did not know how to care for themselves. They explains that they were able to survive with financial support from the government, and assistance from their neighbor who tried to help them as much as she could. At the time the interview was recorded in 1991, the family had not been able to locate their mother, and they did not know if she was still living."

He also speaks about the larger context of these groups and discusses the assassinations of Orlando Letelier, Carlos Muniz, and Eulalio Negrin.

The footage was recorded in Springfield, MA on the 25th anniversary of the Rosenberg's death for a Cuban television program. Bravo asks the Meeropols about their travel to Cuba and their impressions of the country. Much of the video on this recording is in poor condition, and in many places only the audio is available. The children of Michael and Robert Meeropol discuss their visit to Cuba and describe their understanding of how their grandparents died. At the end of the segment the family sings the Cuban folk song \"Guantanamera.\" Beginning at minute 12:00 the video changes to various clips from Cuban television programs. Many of these clips contain no audio. The second half of the video features a boxing match."

It begins with a brief interview with their sons Robert and Michael Meeropol who talk about their parents and the loss they still feel many years after their deaths. The program, which initially aired in 1974, details the legal efforts to grant the Rosenbergs clemency or a stay of execution. The program then provides an update, recorded in 1978, which reviews government documents and questions the impartiality of judge Kaufman, who sentenced the Rosenbergs to death."

                                        "The series contains an assortment of recordings. Some of the videos contain footage that was shot independently, and not for a specific film. Examples of these recordings include clips from Brazil, from Mexico, and an interview concerning the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). This series also contains several clips relating to Nelson Mandela for which the specific film cannot be determined. Other footage that cannot be associated with a specific film due to lack of contextual information is also included in this series. An example is an interview Bravo conducted with three individuals in New York. The original box annotations suggest that these individuals are Dominicans but there is no indication of the specific film.  The conversation with these individuals continues on more than one cassette. It is unclear whether this is independent material or may have been created for a specific film."

Clippings include copies of articles about Estela Bravo's films, interviews, reviews, and biographical articles about her career as a filmmaker. A large portion of this series consists of programs for conferences and documentary film festivals. Bravo's films were shown at many of these festivals but not all. The series also contains several playbills from dance and theatrical performances attended by the Bravos. Playbills do not relate to filmmaking, but rather reflect the artistic interests of the Bravos. Additionally, the series contains copies of the documentaries \u003cspan class=\"emph emph-italic\"\u003ePorque Moncada?\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=\"emph emph-italic\"\u003eManos a la Obra\u003c/span\u003e. These documentaries were not created by Estela Bravo, but they address topics similar to those featured in her films."

Reels contain footage of events including parties, vacations, and visits with family. They feature the Bravos during the early years of their marriage and include footage of personal moments with their children and friends. The home movies were shot in a number of locations including New York, Miami, Paris, and São Paulo. A set of reels in this series were numbered 1-7; these numbers were created by Estela and Ernesto Bravo. Several reels were accompanied with limited contextual information and have yet to be identified. Family films that are in digital formats contain similar content as several of the reels, and many have been modified to contain sound. Several videos have been overlaid with music, while others contain audio of Estela Bravo explaining events captured in the films. Contents of these videos largely document the travels of the Bravos in the 1950s."

Hernández, along with four other Cuban agents, was arrested in Miami in 1998 for spying on the United States, they became known as the Cuban Five. The Cuban government claimed they were spying on anti-Cuban terrorists  in Miami, but the five were ultimately convicted of espionage and acting as foreign agents. In 2014 as US-Cuban relations began to thaw the United States government helped Hernández and Perez conceive a child through artificial insemination. Hernández and two other Cuban agents were released that year in exchange for several American prisoners in Cuba. Hernández returned to Cuba two months before the birth of his daughter, Gema."

The collection contains over 1,300 video tapes and film reels recorded by Bravo throughout her career. In addition to full-length documentaries and video footage, the collection also contains a small amount of ephemera, correspondence, and documentation related to the promotion and licensing of Bravo's films. Footage in this collection consists of interviews with political leaders and celebrities; scenes of important events, marches, demonstrations, and performances; battle footage; historical clips from Cuba's State Council archives; speeches by Fidel Castro, Nelson Mandela, and others; and background footage (b-roll) used in finished films. This footage was primarily recorded on U-matic and Betacam video tapes, and produced on film reels, VHS, and DVD for screening and distribution.",
                        "Many of Bravo's films focus broadly on Cuba after the revolution and its relationship with the United States and other countries. Bravo's films address other issues related to Latin American politics and culture, exploring topics such as: children abducted during Argentina's \"Dirty War;\" Chile under the Pinochet dictatorship; the assassination of Maurice Bishop in Grenada; social and economic problems caused by Latin American debts owed to the United States; struggles to end apartheid in South Africa; and a 1984 concert featuring Cuban musicians Silvio Rodriguez and Pablo Milanes in Buenos Aires.",

There are more than 400 video recordings related to these films. Among the highlights of this material are interviews with notable individuals including: Arthur Schlesinger, Ramsey Clark, George McGovern, Alice Walker, Harry Belafonte, Philip Agee, Ted Turner, Edward Heath, Jorge Risquet, Ricardo Alarcón, Vilma Espín, and Angela Davis. These videos also contain interviews with supporters of the anti-Castro movement including counter-revolutionaries like Orlando Bosch.",
                        "Other films featured prominently in this collection address the social consequences of tensions between the United States and Cuba. These films include \u003cspan class=\"emph emph-italic\"\u003eAmericans in Cuba\u003c/span\u003e, documenting American who moved to Cuba after the revolution; \u003cspan class=\"emph emph-\"\u003eThe Cuban Excludables\u003c/span\u003e, which follows Cubans who came to the United States during the Mariel boatlift and the conditions they faced while being detained by US authorities; and  \u003cspan class=\"emph emph-italic\"\u003eMiami-Havana\u003c/span\u003e, a film that explores the consequences of travel and communication restrictions between Cuba and the United States.",
                        "Not all of Bravo's films are represented in the collection. Footage from some films may be more complete than others, while footage from other films does not appear in the collection at all. In other cases video footage is duplicated in multiple series. Bravo frequently reused older footage in follow-up documentaries to provide background and context for a subsequent film. For example, footage from the 1985 film, \u003cspan class=\"emph emph-italic\"\u003eMissing Children\u003c/span\u003e, also appears in the 2007 documentary, \u003cspan class=\"emph emph-italic\"\u003eWho Am I?: The Found Children of Argentina\u003c/span\u003e. Additionally, there are many interviews that exceed the duration of a single tape, and are recorded on multiple tapes. These interviews will contain pauses and breaks in the conversation to allow the videographer to change tapes.",
                        "The collection also contains footage that was not included in any feature film. These recordings may have been shot with a potential film in mind, but were never included in any completed feature. The Bravos also recorded special events or interviews with notable individuals, even though they did not intend to include them in a specific documentary. These recordings include an interview with Mikis Theodrakis, a Greek songwriter/composer and supporter of Fidel Castro, and an interview with Brazilian Communist Party leader Luis Carlos Prestes (1898-1990). There is also some footage which is unidentified or has not yet been associated with a specific feature film.",
                        "Between 2014 and 2015, two additional donations of periodicals, programs, playbills, transcripts, and related items were added to the collection.

Transcripts and partial transcripts from this donation relate to the film \u003cspan class=\"emph emph-italic\"\u003eFidel: The Untold Story\u003c/span\u003e and have been added to Series VIII. Transcripts contain interviews of some individuals for which there is no film footage, including Walter Sisulu and Kalema Moutante. A small set of film reels, donated in 2014, contain personal family footage of Estela and Ernesto Bravo with friends and family members, most of which were filmed in 1958. These reels are arranged in Series XXXI: Estela and Ernesto Bravo Family Films.",
                        "Many of the dates in this collection have been estimated based on the content and release date of the film. Specific dates are listed if they appeared on the cassette annotations, while others were inferred from the film's content. The word \"Bump\" appears in several titles, and was used by Estela Bravo to indicate clips selected from a previous, longer, piece of footage."

She later began developing television programs and creating short documentaries based on archival footage, which documented notable figures like the Rosenbergs, Malcolm X, and Paul Robeson. Ernesto wrote many of the scripts for these short films. Estela Bravo completed her first full-length documentary in 1980, \u003cspan class=\"emph emph-italic\"\u003eThose Who Left\u003c/span\u003e, which told the story of Cubans who left the island after the 1959 revolution.

These numbers are not sequential and are not listed in a specific order. Individual tapes have been arranged intellectually by the full-length feature in which they appear. Tapes were originally received in boxes containing packing slips that roughly associated footage with specific films. Much of this contextual information was lost, however, due to the immediate separation of materials for preservation treatment. Information about footage content and associated feature film(s) has been reconstructed to the best of the archivist's ability through analysis of container annotations, research, and consultation with the donors. Footage has been added to the series that best represents the context of its use. Estela Bravo frequently reused footage in multiple documentaries, and consequently some footage may be duplicated in more than one series.",

The descriptions of video cassettes that have not yet been digitized often contain phrases in quotation marks. These phrases were copied from annotations on the cassette boxes. As digitized versions of the videos become available, descriptions are being updated.",
