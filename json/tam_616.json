Estela and Ernesto Bravo moved to Cuba in\n        the early 1960s, and as a result many of Estela's films focus on political and cultural\n        relations between the United States and Cuba. The collection contains over 1,300 video tapes\n        and film reels recorded by Bravo throughout her career. In addition to full-length features\n        and video footage, the collection contains a small amount of ephemera, correspondence, home\n        movies, and documentation related to the promotion and licensing of Bravo's films. Footage\n        in this collection consists of interviews with political leaders and celebrities; scenes of\n        historical events, marches, demonstrations, and performances; battle footage; clips from\n        Cuba's State Council archives; speeches by Fidel Castro, Nelson Mandela, and others; and\n        background footage (b-roll) used in finished films. This footage is primarily recorded on\n        U-matic and Betacam video tapes, and produced on film reels, VHS, and DVD for screening and\n        distribution. This collection has been partially digitized, and only the digitized footage\n        is currently accessible to researchers."

She describes her decision to stay in Cuba\n              after the revolution and finding work as a music teacher with the Christian Education\n              Team.

He explains that youth in California in the 1960s were detached\n              and had a very pessimistic view of the future. He explains that life in Cuba at that\n              time felt very different and students were engaged in political climate of the early\n              revolutionary government. He describes meeting his wife at the school he attended, and\n              explains that they married after he had only lived in Cuba for a year. He was only 15\n              years old at the time."

She also discusses how she is received as an American in\n              Cuba, and her children Andrew and Marianne discuss some of the discrimination they\n              faced when they were in primary school and at the university. The end of the interview\n              features a discussion about problems they see in Cuba, notably continued shortage of\n              goods and services, and a growing tourist industry that caters to tourists at the\n              exclusion of Cubans."

Moore and Rios discuss what their lives were like prior to the Cuban revolution\n              and their decision to stay in Cuba. Moore discusses her identity as an American living\n              in Cuba, and her relationship with her family living in America. She explains that her\n              family is not sympathetic to the revolution, and expresses disappointment that US and\n              Cuba have not maintained better relations. Both Rios and Moore discuss how the\n              revolution shaped the direction of their lives, and explain that they stayed in Cuba\n              because of their positive impressions of Fidel Castro. They also briefly discuss\n              raising children in Cuba and the community of Americans who came to live in Cuba\n              following the revolution. Much of the interview features loud background noises that\n              make portions difficult to hear."

She explains that she felt at home in Cuba and decided to stay after being\n              expelled from her American high school because of her political activism. Proctor and\n              her mother talk about racism in the United States, and Proctor explains that as a\n              biracial woman she has felt more in welcome Cuba. She also discusses US policy toward\n              Cuba, her hopes that the US embargo against Cuba will end, and her sense of shame\n              about America's treatment of Cuba. At the end of the interview she expresses her hope\n              that all of her cousins and nephews could come to Cuba to meet her Cuban family.

He\n              criticizes wealthy nations in the north, international banks, creditors, and global\n              financial organizations for taking advantage of Latin America. He argues that economic\n              imperialism has led to Peru's fiscal crisis and has created extreme suffering and\n              poverty in Peru. He contends that the only way to push back against the insurmountable\n              debt payments is through unity among Latin American nations."

Members of the crowd\n              describe their understanding of the war and Cuba's reason for supporting the Angola.\n              Many express their approval of Cuba's role in the war and speak generally about racial\n              equality and the need to fight against apartheid in South Africa. One man discusses\n              his reason for not volunteering to fight, and he argues with many others in the crowd.\n              The second half of this video features an assortment of clips from footage in South\n              Africa including a musical concert, short interviews with South Africans and Angolans,\n              crowd footage, and Cubans who fought in Namibia.

Later they discuss his family, and Pablo cries as he explains that he does not\n              know if he will be able to see them again. The next interview features Orlando Sierra\n              who describes the events that led to his detention by US immigration and the confusing\n              legal process he went through before he was deported. He describes being arrested for\n              several non-violent crimes in the 1980s, being detained by immigration in 1991, and\n              not understanding why he was deported or flagged by immigration at that time."

The interview begins with a discussion of the events that\n              led to the Mariel Boatlift in 1980. Smith cites Cuban attempts to establish normalized\n              immigration policies with the United States, hijackings of Cuban boats by individuals\n              seeking to reach the US, and the occupation of the Peruvian embassy in Cuba in 1980.\n              He talks at length about the legal status of the Mariel Cubans who were listed as\n              excludable, and others who were paroled into the country upon arrival. He also\n              discusses the unique situation of Mariel, and the human rights abuses that many Mariel\n              Cubans faced after they were detained by US immigration."

Smith discusses diplomatic talks between Cuba and the United States that\n              took place under the administration of Jimmy Carter, but were stalled after Ronald\n              Reagan took office. He talks about this history of US immigration policy toward Cuba\n              and expresses his hope that the incoming Clinton administration will normalize\n              relations. The last 10 minutes of the video focus on interviewer Linden McIntyre and\n              feature him restating questions to make them more succinct for the edited film."

Before the interview begins\n              Shoob and Estela Bravo informally discuss Dr. Bolivar Martineau and baseball player\n              Denny McLain. The official interview begins around minute 3:00 and features a\n              discussion about Cubans who were detained by Immigration and Naturalization Services\n              (INS), and the difficulty of obtaining individual trials for these people. He shares a\n              story about a man who he argued never should have been detained by INS, but was held\n              in a US prison for several years because of what he describes as an arbitrary decision\n              and a failure to individually address his case. Shoob also discusses his attempts to\n              gain the release of several detainees and the resistance he encountered from the\n              federal government and prison administrators."

Bourne describes Castro as an elder statesman among nationalist leaders in\n              developing nations, and discusses his image as a role model for other young leaders.\n              He then turns to a discussion about Castro's meeting with Pope John Paul II,\n              describing the dynamic between the two men and the motivations behind the meeting.\n              Bourne speaks about Castro's leadership in Cuba addressing concerns about human\n              rights, and Castro's role as a leader in the post-colonial era. He ends with a brief\n              discussion about the history of American influence in Cuba and his expectations for\n              Cuba's fate after the United States lifts the trade embargo and after Castro leaves\n              office."

He\n              begins by discussing Castro's relationship with his first wife Mirta Díaz-Balart and\n              their son Fidelito. He also discusses Fidel's relationship with Celia Sanchez and the\n              important role she played in his life. He then changes to a discussion about the\n              immediate aftermath of the Cuban revolution, discussing why people decided to leave,\n              the trials of former Batista government officials, and the development of contentious\n              diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba. Bourne ends with several\n              short discussions about Castro's relationship with leaders in Vietnam, Chile,\n              Nicaragua, and Grenada."

Bourne begins with a\n              lengthy discussion about the custody struggle over Elián González and the United\n              States decision to return him to Cuba. He talks about the ways in which the struggle\n              shifted Americans' perceptions of both Cuba and the exile community in Miami. The\n              conversation then shifts to a general discussion about the way American opinions about\n              Cuba are shaped by the press, which Bourne contrasts with that of other Latin American\n              countries. The second part of the interview focuses on human rights in Cuba,\n              healthcare, and education. He also briefly discusses why some Cubans have left the\n              country, the Cuban economy, and the waning support Cuba received from the Soviet Union\n              beginning in the 1980s."

The bulk of the interview focuses on Castellanos work representing\n              Castro, and the other revolutionaries who were arrested after their attack on the\n              Moncada Barracks. He discusses speaking with Díaz-Balart following the attack, and his\n              legal representation of Raúl Castro prior to Fidel's capture. He also discusses the\n              role of Marta Rojas who reported on the trials of the rebels captured at Moncada. At\n              minute 22:44 Castellanos looks through photographs he saved from that period, and an\n              image of Raúl Castro can be seen at the top of the stack.

The bulk of the interview focuses on\n              popular perceptions of Fidel Castro, in which Frady describes him as a figure that\n              inspired passionate reactions, both positive and negative.

The brief footage focuses on a photograph from the event. At minute 3:35 the\n              video changes to an interview with Manuel González Corrales. He discusses his memories\n              of Fidel Castro at the University of Havana and their shared involvement in student\n              activism. He describes the political environment within the university as a microcosm\n              and training ground for the revolutionary movements that developed in Cuba, and later\n              discusses the assassination of Student Federation leader Manolo Castro."

Lesnik details Castro's personality as a young\n              man and suggests that peers viewed him as audacious and likely to achieve prominence.\n              He later addresses a question about racism and notes that as a Jewish man he did face\n              some racism in Cuba, but argues that the generation that he and Castro were a part of\n              held much less prejudice."

He\n              explains that he was placed in el Colegio de Belen, where he met Fidel Castro who was\n              a student at the school. He discusses what Castro was like as a student and an\n              athlete, and describes him as particularly diligent. He shares a long anecdote about\n              Castro's interest in basketball, and also talks about Castro's interest in other\n              sports including soccer, baseball, and track."

Llorente explains that the students had left school\n              in the immediate aftermath of Pearl Harbor to volunteer to fight in World War II, and\n              Castro had promised to keep their decision secret.

In particular he noted that Castro thought Guevara was impatient in his efforts\n              to support revolutionary movements in Bolivia. The second half of the interview\n              focuses on Castro's meeting with Pope John Paul II.

He argues that\n              the United States needs to respect Cuban sovereignty by lifting the blockade and\n              improving diplomatic relations with the Cuban government. Ortega states that he does\n              not think Castro believes in Communism, but rather adopted the political structure in\n              opposition to the United States. He suggests that by aligning with the Soviet Union\n              Castro hoped avoid a US funded coup similar to the overthrow of Jacobo Árbenz in\n              Guatemala. At the end of the interview he discusses his writing career and how his\n              opinions toward Cuba have changed over the years."

Lesnik describes his acquaintance with Castro at the\n              University of Havana, where they were classmates. Lesnik discusses Castro's politics\n              during that era, and the inspiration Castro drew from the political leader Eduardo\n              Chibás and the writings of José Martí.

In the interview\n              Prieto discusses Fidel Castro's interest in studying prominent historical figures like\n              Napoleon and Churchill as well as the history of indigenous peoples and the working\n              class. Prieto discusses his experience traveling internationally with Castro, and the\n              positive and negative perceptions of Castro in the world. He describes Castro as a\n              polarizing figure and talks about perceptions of Castro in Florida, and Miami in\n              particular. Prieto also describes Castro's competitive spirit, and in the second half\n              of the interview he discusses what he thinks Cuba will look like after Castro's\n              presidency. He discusses his optimism for the future of Cuba after Castro, citing\n              strong party unity and active participation from young voters. He also talks about\n              Cuba moving toward a new kind of socialism."

Walker discusses\n              her memories of Castro's 1995 speech at Riverside Church in Harlem, and her experience\n              meeting Castro in person. She addresses American media portrayals of Castro as a\n              dictator, which she says contrasts with her perception of him. Walker also discusses\n              Castro's knowledge of agricultural issues, and concludes that his longevity as a\n              leader in Cuba comes from the support he has from many Cuban citizens. The end of the\n              video features still images of Walker with Castro and during her travels in Cuba."

Appearing in the film are US politicians\n            including Republican Senator and former Representative from Arizona Jeff Flake;\n            Republican former Senator and Representative from Idaho, Larry Craig; Democratic former\n            Representative from Massachusetts, Bill Delahunt; and Democratic Massachusetts\n            Representative, Jim McGovern. In the documentary they contend that travel between the\n            countries builds openness and understanding; strengthens family ties; fosters cultural\n            exchange, tourism and trade; and is a constitutional right for all Americans. No raw\n            footage associated with the film is available. Only a completed version of the\n            documentary is included in this series."

It quickly changes to an interview with Letelier, which begins with a\n              discussion about his early life and his father's assassination. He discusses leaving\n              Chile when he was 3 years old, and returning to Chile later in life. He also talks\n              about his involvement in leftist political movements in Chile and his participations\n              in Chile's Socialist Youth. He discusses the significance of the visit of Pope John\n              Paul II in 1987, and the 1989 general elections. Letelier talks at length about the\n              political climate in Chile at the end of the 1980s discussing the country's transition\n              to democracy and the influence of youth activism.

On July 2,1986, Quintana, along with a\n            young photographer, Rodrigo Andres Rojas de Negri, were participating in a student\n            protest in Santiago. They were attacked and beaten by a patrol of military police,\n            soaked with gasoline, and set on fire. De Negri died of his burns. Gloria suffered\n            second and third degree burns over 62% of her body; she was critically ill and was moved\n            to a hospital in Canada. Although she survived, Gloria was badly disfigured from her\n            burns. When the Pope visited Chile in 1987, she returned and was able to meet with the\n            pontiff in Santiago."

He describes the motivation of many Cuban parents who\n              decided to send their children to the United States in the early 1960s, explaining\n              that many feared their children would be sent to Russia for communist indoctrination.\n              He also discusses his organization's role in clandestine efforts to send Cuban\n              children the US, and explains that parents expected Castro would be overthrown and\n              their children would quickly return. He later discusses children who had a difficult\n              time adjusting to life in the US, and the Miami-based youth organization the Antonio\n              Maceo Brigade, which was outspoken in its support of the Cuban government."

She expresses her hope in the community and\n              her faith that the government will eventually change. The video then focuses on news\n              reports and photos of Carols Godoy and his murder. At minute 17:55 the videos changes\n              to an interview with the executive secretary of the foundation Protection of Youth\n              Damaged by State of Emergency (PIDEE), which helped children whose parents had been\n              harmed, detained, or disappeared by the government. She describes the foundation, its\n              goals, and the kind of support it provides to the children whose families were\n              targeted for political reasons."

The footage features a series of on-the-street interviews\n              conducted by Estela Bravo in Union City, New Jersey in which she asks the men why they\n              traveled to the United States and what they hoped to find. The majority of the men\n              interviewed were living in the United States for less than a year at the time the\n              interviews were conducted. Many mention that they left Cuba because they did not agree\n              with the communist government. Others explain that they left to find better work and\n              earn money although several mention that they have had a difficult time finding work\n              in the United States. They likewise describe finding it difficult to get adequate\n              housing and access to medical care. One man notes that he has received little support\n              from the existing Cuban community in the US, and has received more support from other\n              immigrant groups including Puerto Ricans and Dominicans. Some of the men mention\n              travelling to the US as part of the Mariel Boatlift. The term \"escoria\" refers to a\n              statement made by Fidel Castro about Cuban exiles, comparing those who left to escoria\n              (scum)."

She discusses her husband's assassination, and describes him as a pioneer for\n              calling for improved relations between the US and Cuba in the 1970s. The second\n              interview features anti-Castro political activist Felipe Rivero. Rivero discusses his\n              involvement in the Bay of Pigs invasion and addresses criticism about members of his\n              movement who have been charged with or convicted of terrorism. He specifically\n              discusses members of his organization who were convicted for the assassination of\n              Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier. The third interview features Miami priest Father\n              Bryan Walsh. Walsh discusses his role in sponsoring Cuban children traveling to the US\n              without their parents between 1960 and 1962, and the US government's role in\n              supporting that work.

Video and audio quality is very poor and the bulk of the content on\n              the second half of this tape is difficult to view."

The children of Michael and\n              Robert Meeropol discuss their visit to Cuba and describe their understanding of how\n              their grandparents died. At the end of the segment the family sings the Cuban folk\n              song \"Guantanamera.\" Beginning at minute 12:00 the video changes to various clips from\n              Cuban television programs.

A large portion of this series consists of programs for conferences and\n            documentary film festivals. Bravo's films were shown at many of these festivals but not\n            all. The series also contains several playbills from dance and theatrical performances\n            attended by the Bravos. Playbills do not relate to filmmaking, but rather reflect the\n            artistic interests of the Bravos. Additionally, the series contains copies of the\n            documentaries  and . These documentaries were not created by Estela Bravo, but\n            they address topics similar to those featured in her films."

They feature the Bravos during the early years of\n            their marriage and include footage of personal moments with their children and friends.\n            The home movies were shot in a number of locations including New York, Miami, Paris, and\n            São Paulo. A set of reels in this series were numbered 1-7; these numbers were created\n            by Estela and Ernesto Bravo. Several reels were accompanied with limited contextual\n            information and have yet to be identified. Family films that are in digital formats\n            contain similar content as several of the reels, and many have been modified to contain\n            sound. Several videos have been overlaid with music, while others contain audio of\n            Estela Bravo explaining events captured in the films. Contents of these videos largely\n            document the travels of the Bravos in the 1950s."

The Cuban government claimed\n            they were spying on anti-Cuban terrorists in Miami, but the five were ultimately\n            convicted of espionage and acting as foreign agents. In 2014 as US-Cuban relations began\n            to thaw the United States government helped Hernández and Perez conceive a child through\n            artificial insemination. Hernández and two other Cuban agents were released that year in\n            exchange for several American prisoners in Cuba. Hernández returned to Cuba two months\n            before the birth of his daughter, Gema."
