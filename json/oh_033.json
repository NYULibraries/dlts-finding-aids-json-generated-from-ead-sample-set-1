The majority of the narrators lived in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Other narrators include residents of the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan; members of the Three Arrows Cooperative Society in Putnam Valley, New York; veterans of the Vietnam War; and jazz musicians in New York City between 1940 and 1960.  The narrators reflect the changing ethnic composition of different neighborhoods in New York City, and include Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe; immigrants from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Central America; and migrants from the southern United States and Puerto Rico.  Topics covered by the interviews include life in tenements in the LES, life in public and cooperative housing in the LES, family life, ethnic identities, intercultural and interracial relations in New York City, education, religion, paid and unpaid work, immigration and migration experiences, religious and social activities in East Harlem, Asian American activism, socialist and anarchist organizations, political activism, anti-war movements, community gardens in New York City, and experiences of women in higher education through the 1970s and 1990s.  In addition to the interviews, the collection includes transcripts (full and partial) of interviews, notes on and indexes of interviews, field notes taken by interviewers, and preliminary questionnaires completed by narrators.  Some files include articles and ephemera created by the narrators or are related to the topics they discussed in the interviews."

The interview covers Pauline Arinberg's early life in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and her family.  Arinberg discusses the different apartments in which her family lived in the LES and the fact that the family would move to obtain lower rent.  She discusses her parents, their backgrounds, and their immigration to the United States.  She recounts her father's various occupations, including his trimming store on Christie Street in the LES and his business peddling textiles.  She discusses her mother's occupations as a finisher in the garment industry and as a peddler of house dresses and aprons.  She describes the apartments in which her family lived, particularly the cold and her loneliness after school when her parents were at work.  She discusses ethnic and racial relations in the LES from the early 20th century to the time of the interview.  She recounts going to Central Park in Manhattan, Prospect Park in Brooklyn, and the Yiddish theatre with her mother, and other leisure activities in which she participated.  Other topics include burglaries that took place in her family's apartments, her religious upbringing, and living conditions in the buildings in which her family lived in the LES."

The majority of the interview covers Genya Borut's childhood in Poland, her work in a garment factory, and discussions regarding political philosophies.  Borut recalls playing in fields of flowers and attending primary school in Lublin, Poland.  She attributes her lifelong love of reading and broadened worldview to the \u003cspan class=\"emph emph-italic\"\u003eGrimm's Fairy Tales\u003c/span\u003e.  Borut remembers a bathtub being inside her family's first apartment in Brooklyn, New York which differed from her experience in Poland where the family used a public bath house.  Borut discusses the loud working conditions and low wages at the garment factory in which she worked.  She expresses pride in her decision to join the United Garment Workers of America.  Borut reflects fondly on her late husband and their years of marriage.  Throughout the interview, she discusses various political philosophies, including those of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Karl Marx, Joseph Stalin vs. Leon Trotsky and Malcolm X vs. Martin Luther King Jr."

Breslow discusses growing up on the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York; her relationship with her family; and her participation in Hashomer Hatzair. Breslow describes playing in tenement hallways and in the streets of the LES. She discusses the fact that her parents were older than the parents of other children her age and how she worried as a child that they would die. She describes her relationship with her older siblings who were born in Poland; she describes being inspired by her older sister who returned to college and learned to swim later in life. Breslow discusses the reasons she enjoyed belonging to the Hashomer Hatzair, including folk dancing and the perceived seriousness of the youth group. She describes her preference for Brooklyn over the LES because of its spaciousness and greenery."

The majority of the interview covers Luba Kadison Buloff's experiences as a Yiddish theatre actor and her acting experiences in Europe and the United States (US).  Buloff recalls growing up in the acting world and traveling throughout Europe to perform for various Jewish communities.  Buloff states that after immigrating to the US, she continued to act, that her entire life was related to theatre, and that she did not socialize outside of the troupe.  Buloff described 2nd Avenue in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York as lively due to the large volume of Yiddish theatres and high attendance of each show.  She explains that by the 1940s, she thought that the Yiddish theatre had become too commercialized, which led her to move to Chicago, Illinois.  Buloff explains that she felt that the New York Yiddish theatre became less about the art of acting and more about profits and fame."

DeAngelo's husband, Sam DeAngelo, participates in the first half of the interview.  The interview covers Rose DeAngelo's family and working life.  DeAngelo discusses her childhood, including the apartments in which her family lived and the fact that her mother had 15 children.  She discusses the death of seven of her siblings as infants, causes of infant mortality in the early 20th century, and the death of her father.  She describes her siblings, their careers, and their families.  DeAngelo and her husband recount their wedding and their 50th and 60th anniversary celebrations.  Sam DeAngelo discusses discipline in school and at home, his working life, and his and Rose's reasons for staying in the LES.  Rose DeAngelo discusses different jobs she had in an unspecified hat factory,  at the American Steel Wool Manufacturing Company factory, as a tomato packer at an unspecified factory, and as a seamstress in an unspecified garment factory in the LES.  She explains that she and her friend were strike breakers in the hat factory and her opinions of labor unions before and after this experience.  She discusses the custom of having midwives attend at home births, her mother's four sets of twins, and their mortality rate.  DeAngelo describes her work as a seamstress at Post Manufacturing Company on Lafayette Street, including the types of athletic clothes she made, the decline of the business, and working conditions in the factory.  She describes the apartments in which she lived in the LES and sections of the neighborhood, including Worth Street and Mulberry Street Park.  Other topics include military service of DeAngelo's family members, crime in the LES in the 1910s and at the time of the interview, Italian residents of the LES, and benefits of her membership in an unspecified labor union (likely the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America)."

The interview is difficult to hear, due to a lot of background noise.  The majority of the interview covers Dell's childhood experiences growing up in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan and owning Katz's Delicatessen.  Dell explains the rules of box baseball, stickball, punchball, kick the can, and marbles.  He recalls having to pause in the middle of stickball games to allow cars to drive past the game.  Dell describes why Katz's Delicatessen is popular, stating his belief that maintaining their same means of operation, menu, location, and food preparation have all attributed to the delicatessen's continual success."

The interview is primarily with Nellie Dick and her son, Jim Dick, occasionally participates.  The majority of the interview covers Nellie Dick's recollections of anarchist communities in London, England; New York; and New Jersey.   Dick recalls attending a lecture given by Johann Rudolf Rocker in London when she was eight or nine years old and being the only child present at the lecture.  She explains that her immersion into politics at a young age resulted in her dedicated involvement in the anarchist community.  Dick goes into detail about what she considers to be the fundamental differences between anarchists and Communists, one being the belief that there should be a bit of a hierarchy to the working and social structure of a community.  She describes teaching herself to read Yiddish and her eagerness to learn.  Dick recalls working closely with her fellow principals at the Modern School to write the \u003cspan class=\"emph emph-italic\"\u003eVoice of the Children\u003c/span\u003e, a Stelton Colony publication.  As leaders of the Ferrer Colony, Nellie and her husband each proposed and carried out projects to better the community, including better living conditions for the boarding school students and improvements to school buildings.  She explains that not only did the students attend classes at the school, they were also responsible for maintaining the grounds of the school.  Dick describes teaching her students manners as she strongly believed in etiquette and discipline.  Dick expresses her adoration for the Stelton Colony and her pride as a contributing leader of that community, as she was a proponent of always improving the community.  She also explains the colony's mission, which expresses the importance of responsibility in order to have freedom, and the living atmosphere of the Ferrer Colony.  Dick explains that she knew she belonged within the Ferrer Colony because she shared the outstanding belief that there should be a change in government and that all individuals should receive an education."

Ida Fier describes her childhood and adolescence in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. She describes witnessing her father's death of a heart attack and her embarrassment at her mother's subsequent decision to become the janitor at their 232 Rivington Street apartment. Fier discusses her relationship with her mother, in particular her support of Fier's desire to attend college and their conflict over Orthodox Judaism. She describes feeling unable to discuss abortion and menstruation with her mother. Fier describes the importance of local institutions such as the Henry Street Settlement and the local library for entertainment and education. She describes doing schoolwork at the public library when there were guests at home, going to school during the summer to learn basket and rug weaving, and taking piano lessons at the Henry Street Settlement. She discusses the limited enforcement of quarantines in the LES. Fier discusses joining the Communist Party of the United States of America in college and being a student teacher at Seward Park High School. Fier discusses the impact of nostalgia on accounts of the LES by her generation, arguing that people are sentimental about their youths because their lives had more potential."

The majority of the interview covers Deborah Borgenicht Flynn's memories of her family, in particular her father, Louis Borgenicht.  Laist asks questions regarding passages from Harold Friedman's biography, \u003cspan class=\"emph emph-italic\"\u003eThe Happiest Man: The Life of Louis Borgenich\u003c/span\u003et, and asks Flynn for confirmation and details about certain stories.  Flynn recalls accompanying her father to his garment factory, Borgenicht and Spiro, Inc., in Manhattan, New York.  She describes her father's work ethic, but cannot recall specific details regarding his business.  Flynn recalls visiting the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan at a young age with her mother and bringing food to poor Jewish families.  Flynn describes the tenement buildings in the LES as very crowded and dirty and compares this to her experiences in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.",

She recalls the doctor running electricity from the hallway in order to use the necessary medical tools for the surgery.  Friedman recalls playing on the fire escape during the summer and neighbors gathering to sit on the building stoops.  She describes the abundance of pushcarts in the LES that sold various food items and dry goods."

She describes her family's apartments on Broome and Monroe Streets in the LES, the neighborhoods around each apartment, and the family's living arrangements.  She discusses her dislike of the public baths, particularly having to bathe with strangers.  She discusses attending the Madison House summer camp when she was eight years old and remembers the differences between life in the LES and in the country.  She discusses attending events and participating in activities at settlement houses in the LES, in particular the Madison House and an unspecified settlement house on Hester Street.  She describes events and customs in the LES surrounding local and national elections.

The interview covers Kalawsky's early life in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and her family.  Throughout the interview, Kalawsky describes her family's apartments in the LES, living arrangements in the apartments, appliances in the apartments, the ways in which the family members negotiated privacy for themselves in the apartment.  She discusses her parents' responsibilities as the janitors in the buildings in which they lived.   She discusses her mother, her jobs outside of the home, and her feelings about working outside of the home, in particular her enjoyment of discussing politics with her coworkers.  She discusses her father's work for the City of New York as a watchman on construction sites.  She discusses her parents' relationship and their immigration experiences.  She discusses her Irish neighbors, a Catholic church in her neighborhood to which she wanted to belong, and the fact that she wanted to be Irish rather than Russian.  Kalawsky discusses the death of her oldest sister from spinal meningitis when she was seven years old and her mother's feelings about illness in the family after the death of her daughter.  She discusses her relationship with her parents, the fact that her mother worried over her safety and the games and skills her father taught her.  She recalls her memories of the different ethnic groups that lived together in the LES, in particular the foods of each group and her opinion that the diversity was beneficial to the people living in the neighborhood.  Other topics include traditions in her home during Easter and Christmas and games she would play with her friends."

The majority of the interview covers Moe Kertman's efforts to avoid becoming Americanized and his membership in the Russian Social Democratic Party.  He recalls his struggle to conform to American culture and the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Kertman describes the LES as very crowded and explains that he thought the majority of the residents had become Americanized and that he felt excluded because of this.  Kertman discusses his feelings about this Americanization and he disapproval for the immigrants who, in his opinion, had abandoned their home country's language, attitude and general way of life.  He explains that he found purpose and community within the Communist Party of the United States of America because they were activity in the community and stood for causes that he felt would better society."

The interview covers Marrin's experiences as a member of the Board of Directors at the Henry Street Settlement in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York and her working life.  Marrin discusses the beginning of her involvement with the Henry Street Settlement as a volunteer in the Drama Department and Pete's House Productions working with Joseph Balfior.  She discusses ethnic and racial tensions in the LES and the ways in which the staff of the Drama Department sought to teach the children and teenagers how to resolve them.  She recounts her idea to coordinate the drama, dance, and music programs as a unified arts program at the Settlement and the fact that this led to her invitation to join the Board of Directors in 1966.  She explains that she became involved in fundraising activities, continued with her drama classes, and worked as a nurse until she had children and no longer had time to dedicate to volunteering.  She recounts her decisions to leave her nursing position in 1973, to become a lobbyist in Albany for a state senator for ten years, and to enroll in law school at Pace University in Manhattan.  She discusses the creation of the Settlement's Art Show between 1987 and 1989 and her idea to have it at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan.  She describes Jimmy Robinson, the head of the Youth Program, and his Cavaliers program, and the leader of the Youth Program at the time of the interview.  Other topics include the creation of the Settlement's Urban Family Center and Arts Center, her experiences as a lobbyist, and the Friends of Henry Street."

The majority of this interview covers Mitch Miller's research on twentieth century anarchism in New York, specifically in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, as well as in Europe.  He discusses the decline of the Yiddish language, the Spanish Civil War, and compares anarchism in the period between the 1950s and 1970s to politics in the United States (US) at the time of the interview.  Miller describes the Lower East Side to be located below Fourteenth Street and East of Second Avenue.  He references the book, Fragments, written by Sam Dolgoff throughout his interview and relates that Dolgoff played an active role in the anarchist movement during the twentieth century in the Lower East Side (LES).  Miller explains the tension between various ethnic groups in the LES, including gang fights between Jewish, Irish, and Italian residents and relates his opinion that between 1900 and 1940 neighborhoods were the center of people's lives."

The interview covers Nora O'Malley's childhood in Ireland, her family, and her experiences as a cook at the Henry Street Settlement in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.

The majority of the interview covers Helen Pearl's early life in Romania and her lack of happiness throughout her life.  Pearl recalls her mother struggling to financially support the family after her parents'  divorce.  She reflects negatively on her childhood, the time during which she lived with her uncle, and her lack of education.  Pearl explains that she married her husband not for love, but to start a family.  Throughout the interview, Pearl is extremely emotional and expresses great sadness about her life as a whole.  She recalls finding it difficult to work in addition to raising her children.  Pearl describes finding comfort with the Jewish population in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan and missing that sense of community when she moved to the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn."

The majority of the interview covers Julius Schatsky's childhood and life in a Jewish household in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  Schatsky recalls living in three different apartments on Henry Street.  He describes one of the family's apartments, including a bathtub in the kitchen with a removable cover that functioned as additional counter space, and the shared bathroom in the hallway.  He speaks fondly of his many neighborhood friends and the street games they played together.  He remembers joining the Cub Scouts at the Educational Alliance in the Lower East Side and attending a summer picnic sponsored by the Henry Street Settlement in White Plains, New York.  ",

The majority of the interview covers Schatsky's childhood and life in a Jewish household in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  Schatsky recalls moving from 253 Henry Street to 254 Henry Street and his opinion that the latter was more modern because it had a bathroom inside the apartment rather than in the hallway.  He describes feeling a sense of inferiority when he would accompany his mother on her trips to the welfare office during the 1930s and 1940s.  Schatsky states that the street and the Henry Street Settlement in the Lower East Side provided space for the neighborhood children to play together.  He also discusses his philosophical opinions about being Jewish, the importance of friendship, and his love for New York City.  See also Julius Schatsky's interview."

The majority of the interview covers Norman Shapiro's family's winery.  Shapiro recalls thousands of people lining up outside the winery during Passover in order to purchase wine.  He states that since the opening of their store, his family made and sold their own wine.  Shapiro explains that he was 12 years old when he first started working at the family winery in order to assist with bottling the wine.  He suggests that, at the time of the interview, the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan had changed from a primarily Jewish neighborhood to include people from Puerto Rico and China.  Shapiro argues that people were happier during the 1940s and 1960s because their families lived closeby and were able to share in traditions like the Passover seder.  He expresses his opinion that the LES has been affected negatively with the shift of immigrant populations."

Berman at Rose Singer's apartment in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.  The interview covers Singer's experiences in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and at the Henry Street Settlement in the LES, particularly as a member of the Alcott Club.  Singer describes the Vladeck Houses in the LES and recounts moving there in 1940.  She discusses her membership in the Alcott Club at the Henry Street Settlement, her participation in other events and activities at the Settlement, and her friends at the Settlement.  She explains that she developed confidence through these activities at the Settlement.  She discusses her early life in the LES, her unhappiness at moving to the neighborhood as a teenager after the death of her father, and compares the LES with Yonkers in the 1920s and 1930s.  She recounts her early working life in the early 1930s as a children's clothing inspector and the working conditions in the factory in which she worked.  She discusses her parents and the ways in which her mother supported the family after her husband's death in 1927.  ",
                                                "Singer discusses her involvement in the Henry Street Settlement in the LES and recounts her first memories of the Settlement in the 1930s.  She discusses the settlement houses' social programs and the ways in which they benefited the LES.  She discusses the sense of community she felt at the Henry Street Settlement and the freedom she felt being away from her young children and her husband for a short time.  She explains that her husband at first resented her involvement with the Settlement, his resentment at having to care for their children while she went out, and her resentment of his leisure activities and the double-standard that existed in their family.  She describes holiday activities at the Settlement, in particular the fact that the different ethnic and religious groups at the Settlement would work together to create inclusive events before Irish and Italian members formed separate groups based on ethnic identities.  She describes the Settlement programs in which the Alcott Club took a particular interest, including working for better housing in the LES, a cooperative milk program, and clothing swaps.  Other topics include her memories of the Great Depression, discussion of her husband's working life, and her memories of Helen Hall."

A second interview was conducted on April 7, 1993 by Halvorson at Solomon's house.  The main topics of the interviews include Solomon's knowledge of members of the Vanguard Group, an anarchist political group active during the 1930s in New York City and her experiences living in the Ferrer Colony in Stelton, New Jersey.  Solomon recalls her parents hosting gatherings at the family's apartment on Avenue B and Twelfth Street in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan at which anarchism and the Modern School Movement were discussed.  She discusses her parents' decision to join the Ferrer Colony and describes the house her parents built in the Colony.  Solomon recalls her physical education teacher, James Dick, and her enjoyment of soccer and basketball as a child.  She reflects fondly upon her life at the Colony and states that the community evoked an atmosphere of freedom.",

Laist at Sally Spiro Stern's apartment in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  The interview includes both audio and video recordings.  The majority of the interview covers Stern's memories of her family, in particular her grandfather, Louis Borgenicht and her father, Jack D. Spiro.  Stern's description and opinions of her grandfather differ from what is expressed in Harold Friedman's biography of him, \u003cspan class=\"emph emph-italic\"\u003eThe Happiest Man: The Life of Louis Borgenicht\u003c/span\u003e.  She argues his book describes him as a positive, fair minded, and hardworking man when he was actually very unpleasant and cold.  Stern also argues that it was her grandmother who had the successful business ideas, not her grandfather.  She explains the emphasis on Jewish traditions in her family, including family dinners, marriage, and the importance of education.  Stern recalls the sense of community amongst Jewish people in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  She describes her first experience of anti-semitism at the University of Michigan in the mid 1940s."

The majority of the interview covers Beverly Fischer Weinstein's childhood experiences being raised by her widowed mother in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  She vividly describes the family's apartment on Madison Street in the LES apartment and the fact that it was an entire floor of the building and a railroad style apartment.  Weinstein discusses the fact that their apartment was near her family's leather business.  She discusses her friends' reactions to her apartment and to the LES and their comparisons between the LES and  the neighborhoods in which they lived in upper Manhattan.  Weinstein recalls visiting the Educational Alliance and being a member of the Young Israel Synagogue of Manhattan.  She discusses the importance of family; weekly Sunday visits from relatives who lived in Newark, New Jersey; and her participation in many weddings.  She expresses pride in her education and work experiences and explains that she was glad she waited until she was about 30 years old to get married.  Weinstein states that she enjoyed her independence and argued that it allowed her to gain meaningful experiences which she might not have been able to have if she had gotten married and started a family at an earlier age."

                                                "Beverly Fischer Weinstein was born into a Jewish family in 1935 in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Her parents immigrated to the United States (US) from Poland in the early 1900s.  Her maternal grandfather was the schochet, or ritual slaughterer, for the Jewish community of Newark, New Jersey.  In 1923, Weinstein's parents married and moved to the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn.  Her father managed a wholesale leather business in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan.  After the birth of her eldest brother, the family moved to an apartment on Henry Street in the LES.  After the death of her father when Weinstein was two years old, her mother managed the business and raised her five children.  Between 1937 and 1955, the family lived in a three bedroom apartment on Madison Street in the LES.  She earned her bachelor's degree in sociology and psychology from City College in Manhattan.  Weinstein worked as a psychiatrist at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens.  During her 20s, Weinstein travelled and worked in Israel for a few years, before returning to the US and working at Columbia-Presbyterian Clinic located in Upper Manhattan.  She married in 1964 and had children.  The family moved to the Fresh Meadows neighborhood of Queens, where she lived at the time of the interview."

The interview covers Zweibach's early life in the LES and her family.  Zweibach describes the apartments in which her family lived in the LES, the amenities and utilities, the layouts, the living arrangements, and the ways in which the family members negotiated privacy for themselves.  She describes her relationship with her brother, in particular her resentment of him when they were children and their relationship at the time of the interview.  She discusses her father's jobs, including losing his work as an egg candler when machines were introduced to do that work, and his work as an unskilled laborer in various temporary jobs.  She discusses her family's finances while her father could not find permanent work, her parents becoming janitors in one of the buildings in which they lived, and the shame of having to receive home relief benefits during the Great Depression.  She recounts gaining a job as a summer school teacher in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens through the Works Progress Administration.  She describes her mother, including her relationship with her brothers and her feminism, which Zweibach credits for her receiving a college education and becoming a professional.  Other topics include her jealousy over her brother's religious education, her love of the public library and reading, and her membership in the Workmen's Circle in Manhattan."

The interviews document life and work in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York throughout the 20th century.  The narrators lived and worked in the LES between the 1910s and 1990s and are mainly Jewish first-generation Americans of Eastern European descent.  Other narrators include immigrants and children of immigrants from Eastern Europe, Ireland, and Italy; African-American migrants and children of migrants from the southern United States; and a child of migrants from Puerto Rico.  ",
                                        "The interviews include descriptions of apartments in tenements and public housing and neighborhoods in the LES, discussions of single and dual parent households and divorce in the early 20th century, and relations between Jewish residents of the LES with other ethnic and religious groups in the neighborhood.  Narrators discuss social and leisure activities in the LES, including the Yiddish theatre, and discuss the importance of the settlement houses to residents of the LES.  Narrators describe paid and unpaid work inside and outside of the home, immigration and migration experiences, labor union activity, and political activism.  Many of the interviews contain discussions surrounding Jewish identity in terms of religious and cultural traditions, in particular narrators comparing their experiences as first-generation Americans with their parents' experiences as immigrants.

                                        "The interviews conducted in 1991 focus on the Henry Street Settlement in the LES.  The narrators were staff, board members, teachers and former students of the Music School, participants in the Home Planning Workshop, and members of the Henry Street Oldtimers.  These interviews cover a wide range of topics relating to the Settlement and the LES, with the majority focusing on the narrators' memories of staff, programs, activities, and events at the Settlement between the 1910s and the 1940s and the importance of the Settlement to the residents of the LES.  Many of the narrators discuss their memories of Helen Hall, the director of the Settlement between 1933 and 1967.  The narrators include early residents of the Vladeck Houses in the LES who compare the apartments as they were in 1940 and at the time of the interview. ",

The interviews include vivid descriptions of the layouts of the apartments and living arrangements within them.  Narrators describe the neighborhoods and stores in the LES and discuss education and social activities in the LES.",

Graduate students enrolled in the oral history classes taught by Rachel Bernstein in the New York University Department of History collaborated with the Tenement Museum, Henry Street Settlement House, and the Workmen's Circle in Manhattan to collect interviews with people who lived in the LES between the 1910s and 1990s.  Most of the interviews were conducted by graduate students in Bernstein's classes with some interviews conducted in 1993 by volunteers from the Workmen's Circle, who were trained by Bernstein in two day-long seminars.  The interviews conducted by the Workmen's Circle volunteers were used in planning the design of the Tenement Museum at 97 Orchard Street in the LES."

His parents sent Akiya and his siblings to Japan for their education in 1915. Akiya returned to the US in 1932, giving up his dual Japanese citizenship, in order to escape being drafted into the Japanese Army. During World War II he was interned at the Topaz War Relocation Camp in Utah. Akiya worked at two banks, the Office of Strategic Services, a furniture store, and at the University of Michigan as a Japanese teacher. In 1987, Akiya received the Martin Luther King, Jr. Award for Community Organizing."

She left the camp to work at a segregated United Service Organization office for Japanese American soldiers in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Kochiyama met her husband in 1943. After the war, they moved to Manhattan, New York and raised their six children. Kochiyama was active in Asian and African American groups."

The interview covers Eddy's early life in Connecticut, his experiences during World War II, and his experiences in East Harlem as a Protestant minister.  Eddy describes New Britain, Connecticut and discusses the relationship between the Yankee residents and the immigrants who settled in New Britain in the early 20th century.  He describes his grandparents, their personalities, and their influences on him.  He describes his experiences during World War II (WWII) and recounts his duties a volunteer ambulance driver with the American Field Service in northern Africa and the Middle East.  He compares the experiences of soldiers during WWII and those who served in the Vietnam War, and the impressions he had of how American civilians perceived the experiences of soldiers and civilians living in countries affected by the war.  He explains that after his service in the war, he decided to take time to decide what career he wanted for himself.  He recounts his experiences between 1944 and 1948, traveling throughout the United States, working on farms, and learning about different religions.  He describes a spiritual experience he had during WWII in Syria, and his interest in Buddhism, Islam, and mystical parts of Judaism.  He explains how this experience inspired him to serve the spiritual needs of people and his belief at the time that this would not be possible in established Protestant churches.  He recounts taking courses at the Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan in 1945.  He discusses his work as a farm laborer in different areas of the United States between 1945 and 1948 and studying in New York City during the winters.  He recounts enrolling full time at the Seminary, working in East Harlem, and joining the East Harlem Protestant Parish and moving to East Harlem in 1949.  He describes the sense of community he witnessed in East Harlem amongst the Puerto Rican, African American, Eastern European, and Italian residents of the neighborhood.  He explains that while everyone was aware of the ways in which their neighbors were different from them, they were connected by the fact that they were neighbors and lived together.  He discusses the work of the Metro North Citizens' Committee and the Parish to ensure the residents of the neighborhood had adequate housing.  He discusses the ways in which public housing projects positively and negatively affected the community and compares them to the tenements they replaced."

The majority of the interview covers Darline Tremont and Diedra L'Ouverture's childhoods in Haiti.  Tremont recalls growing up in a very structured household in which education held precedence.  She explains her reasons for not practicing one particular religion and describes her belief in a greater force that is beyond the basic human existence.  L'Ouverture recalls experiencing discrimination in each place she lived due to her family being practitioners of Vodou.  She explains that the pantheon of Vodou brings her comfort and security.  She discusses her experiences in the various countries and states in which she lived prior to New York City.  Both Tremont and L'Ouverture discuss the common perceptions of Haitians and provide examples of discrimination they have faced, mostly regarding the common idea that Haitians are all poor and uneducated."

Spencer at the Seward Park Houses in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  The interview covers Leonard Wertheim's life in the LES and his experiences in the Seward Park Cooperative buildings.  His wife, Ellen Wertheim, occasionally contributes to the interview.  Leonard Wertheim describes the buildings in which his family lived on Goerck Street and Baruch Place in the LES.  He describes the LES in the 1940s and his memories of a close-knit neighborhood.  He discusses his parents and grandparents, their histories, and their immigration experiences.  He describes his mother, her working life, and the fact that she cared for her mother later in life.  He describes his religious education and studying for his bar mitzvah.  He describes his family's apartments in the Lavanburg Homes and the Bernard M. Baruch Houses in the LES.  He describes his father, his working life, and his reputation in the neighborhood as a friendly and helpful person.  He discusses his involvement in the Boys Brotherhood Republic in Manhattan, activities and events at the organization, and other members of the organization.  He discusses his family's move to the Seward Park Cooperative buildings in the LES and compares the buildings in the 1950s and the time of the interview.

                                                        "Wertheim discusses a lawsuit brought against the Seward Park Cooperative buildings in the 1980s and describes the changes in the ethnic and racial backgrounds of the residents in the 1980s and 1990s.  He explains that the majority of the residents were Jewish and the reasons why the residents may not have wanted to accept Latino and African-American residents.  He states his opinion that the safety, cleanliness, and infrastructure of the buildings had declined after more Latino and African-American people moved into the buildings in the 1980s and 1990s.  He and his wife discuss social events and activities sponsored by settlement houses and the cooperative buildings in the LES, including trips, summer camps, and parties.  He discusses the history of the cooperative buildings in the LES and the fact that he learned about it through annual meetings and newsletters.  Other topics include his children and a discussion of crime in the LES in the 1940s through the time of the interview."

This recording consists of four individual interviews with Gary Torres, Louis Rentas, Henry Mambo, and Charlie Horse.  The interviews cover each man's experiences playing stickball.  Rentas and Mambo provide brief personal introductions.  The interviews with Torres and Horse are more detailed and include discussions of their personal lives.  Torres recalls the crowds of people who would gather to watch stickball games on Saturdays and Sundays in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  He discusses the fact that people would watch from their windows and fire escapes, and would often throw money to the players.  Horse explains how stickball provided him with a recreational and positive social outlet which helped him resist gang activities."

The majority of the interview covers Manson's childhood in the Harlem and Lower East Side (LES) neighborhoods of Manhattan and his experience at the Three Arrows Cooperative Society (3A)  in Putnam Valley, New York.  Manson recalls playing in the street in the LES, in particular running underneath horses.  He describes the poverty of his family and their neighbors.  Manson explains various political and socialist philosophies, and discusses his memberships to the Young People's Socialist League, the War Resisters' League, 3A, and the Hebrew Free Loan Society.  He goes into detail about his financial struggles as a young adult and how he borrowed money from the Hebrew Free Loan Society who offered interest-free loans to its members.  He discusses in detail the fundamentals of the Hebrew Free Loan Society and the types of loans services they provided for its members.  Manson explains that he joined 3A because it required its members to accept cooperative living principles, like common ownership of property, and overall community involvement.  He describes giving public speeches to the 3A community as well as to neighborhoods in Manhattan.",

The majority of the interview covers Bernice Kaufman Nisinson's experiences as a member of the Young Democratic Socialists (YDS) and her interest in political and religious philosophies.  She recalls the large selection of student run clubs at James Madison High School in Brooklyn and the fact that she attended a meeting for each club as a way to decide which ones she would like to join.  Nisinson argues that it is important to develop your own life philosophy.  She spends a majority of her interview discussing general socialist and Jewish beliefs including the importance of education, the emphasis of family togetherness and carrying on traditions."

                                        "This series contains interviews conducted by students in Rachel Bernstein's 1995 Oral History class.  The narrators include residents of the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York; Asian American activists; Central American, African, and Caribbean immigrants who settled in New York City in the 1980s and 1990s; members of the Three Arrows Cooperative Society in Putnam Valley, New York; and residents of public and cooperative housing in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  The narrators who lived in East Harlem were members of the East Harlem Protestant Parish, stickball players, or were involved with the Young Lords activist organization.  The East Harlem Protestant Parish interviews cover the founding of the church and its work in East Harlem.  The stickball interviews contain discussions of different forms of stickball popular in East Harlem through the 1940s and 1960s and amateur and professional stickball teams in New York City from the 1940s to the time of the interview.  The interviews conducted with Asian American activists cover their participation in political and social movements, including Asian Americans for Action, Harlem Parents' Committee, and the Organization on African American Unity.  These interviews include discussions of the narrators' experiences in the internment camps in the western United States (US) during World War II and of discrimination.  The interviews with Central American, African, and Caribbean immigrants include discussions of immigration experiences, comparisons of life in the US and the narrators' countries of origins, and discrimination experienced by the narrators in the US.  The majority of the Central American narrators were Nicaraguan or lived in Nicaragua in the 1970s and 1980s, and relate their experiences of the Nicaraguan Revolution between 1979 and 1990.  The members of the Three Arrows Cooperative Society (3A) in Putnam Valley, New York describe the community and its principles and their participation other political and social organizations, including the Young People's Socialist League and the Workmen's Circle.  The Young Lords interviews discuss the history and activities of the organization in New York City in the 1970s and 1980s."

Burke discusses his experiences working as a warehouseman at the Western Electric Kearny Works in Kearny, NJ between 1929 and 1931 and working odd jobs after he was laid off in 1931.  He recounts his first experiences working as a longshoreman, including the type of work that was available during the Great Depression and extortion of the new workers on the docks.  He discusses the formation of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) Local 1247.  He discusses the work patterns on the docks, the formation of work gangs, and pay rates for different types of cargo.  He recounts becoming a foreman and the difference in work for longshoreman and foremen.  He lists the different ports in which he worked: Hoboken, Jersey City, and Edgewater in New Jersey, and Staten Island and Brooklyn in New York.  He explains the ways in which information was disseminated about which ports had work.  Other topics include strikes and organized crime involvement in the ILA and on the docks."

The majority of the narrators lived in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Other narrators lived in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan or were members of the Asian American political movements or the Three Arrows Cooperative Society in Putnam Valley, New York.  The narrators reflect the changing ethnic composition of different neighborhoods in New York City, and include Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe; immigrants from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Central America; and migrants from the southern United States and Puerto Rico.  Topics covered by the interviews include life in tenements in the LES, life in public and cooperative housing in the LES, family life, ethnic identities, intercultural and interracial relations in New York City, education, religion, paid and unpaid work, immigration and migration experiences, religious and social activities in East Harlem, Asian American activism, socialist and anarchist organizations, and political activism.  In addition to the interviews, the collection includes transcripts (full and partial) of interviews, notes on and indexes of interviews, field notes taken by interviewers, and preliminary questionnaires completed by narrators.  Some files include articles and ephemera created by the narrators or are related to the topics they discussed in the interviews."
