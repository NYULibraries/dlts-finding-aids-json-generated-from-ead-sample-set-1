The majority of the interview covers\n              Nellie Dick's recollections of anarchist communities in London, England; New York; and\n              New Jersey. Dick recalls attending a lecture given by Johann Rudolf Rocker in London\n              when she was eight or nine years old and being the only child present at the lecture.\n              She explains that her immersion into politics at a young age resulted in her dedicated\n              involvement in the anarchist community. Dick goes into detail about what she considers\n              to be the fundamental differences between anarchists and Communists, one being the\n              belief that there should be a bit of a hierarchy to the working and social structure\n              of a community. She describes teaching herself to read Yiddish and her eagerness to\n              learn. Dick recalls working closely with her fellow principals at the Modern School to\n              write the , a Stelton Colony\n              publication. As leaders of the Ferrer Colony, Nellie and her husband each proposed and\n              carried out projects to better the community, including better living conditions for\n              the boarding school students and improvements to school buildings. She explains that\n              not only did the students attend classes at the school, they were also responsible for\n              maintaining the grounds of the school. Dick describes teaching her students manners as\n              she strongly believed in etiquette and discipline. Dick expresses her adoration for\n              the Stelton Colony and her pride as a contributing leader of that community, as she\n              was a proponent of always improving the community. She also explains the colony's\n              mission, which expresses the importance of responsibility in order to have freedom,\n              and the living atmosphere of the Ferrer Colony. Dick explains that she knew she\n              belonged within the Ferrer Colony because she shared the outstanding belief that there\n              should be a change in government and that all individuals should receive an\n              education."

The majority of the\n              interview covers Norman Shapiro's family's winery. Shapiro recalls thousands of people\n              lining up outside the winery during Passover in order to purchase wine. He states that\n              since the opening of their store, his family made and sold their own wine. Shapiro\n              explains that he was 12 years old when he first started working at the family winery\n              in order to assist with bottling the wine. He suggests that, at the time of the\n              interview, the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan had changed from a primarily\n              Jewish neighborhood to include people from Puerto Rico and China. Shapiro argues that\n              people were happier during the 1940s and 1960s because their families lived closeby\n              and were able to share in traditions like the Passover seder.

The majority of the interview\n              covers Stern's memories of her family, in particular her grandfather, Louis Borgenicht\n              and her father, Jack D. Spiro. Stern's description and opinions of her grandfather\n              differ from what is expressed in Harold Friedman's biography of him, . She argues\n              his book describes him as a positive, fair minded, and hardworking man when he was\n              actually very unpleasant and cold. Stern also argues that it was her grandmother who\n              had the successful business ideas, not her grandfather. She explains the emphasis on\n              Jewish traditions in her family, including family dinners, marriage, and the\n              importance of education. Stern recalls the sense of community amongst Jewish people in\n              the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. She describes her first experience of\n              anti-semitism at the University of Michigan in the mid 1940s."

The\n                recording contains individual interviews with George Calvert, Mercedes Ortiz, and\n                Elizabeth \"Buffy\" Calvert. George Calvert's interview covers his work as a minister\n                in the East Harlem Protestant Parish. He recalls the early years of his seminary\n                field work in East Harlem and his involvement in the community's youth ministry as a\n                youth group administrator. He describes in detail a speaking tour of universities in\n                the southern United States in which he participated in February 1960. He recounts\n                preaching sermons and administering youth bible study groups of interracial groups\n                of students during the speaking tour.. Mercedes Ortiz's interview was conducted on\n                October 9 and October 22, 1995. She discusses her childhood in Puerto Rico and her\n                family's farm. Ortiz discusses her mother's management of the farm and describes the\n                process of making cheese. Ortiz describes her involvement in the Church of the Son\n                of Man and the fact that her knowledge of English and Spanish allows her to\n                contribute to the community through her translation of sermons. Throughout the\n                interview she stresses the importance of her faith and the fact that it provided her\n                with inner strength. Buffy Calvert recalls experiences during her teenage and early\n                adult years in which she fought racial and gender discrimination, including\n                supporting racial diversity within her sorority. She describes her desire to work in\n                a the religious ministry in New York City and explains her opinion that, racial\n                integration would only occur if white people voluntarily integrated primarily\n                African-American and Latino neighborhoods. She describes her experiences living in\n                East Harlem and and recalls enjoying its liveliness, culture, and honesty of its\n                residents. She discusses a summer volunteer, church work camp for college students\n                that she and her husband managed and recounts the first year of the camp.

The interview covers\n                Eddy's early life in Connecticut, his experiences during World War II, and his\n                experiences in East Harlem as a Protestant minister. Eddy describes New Britain,\n                Connecticut and discusses the relationship between the Yankee residents and the\n                immigrants who settled in New Britain in the early 20th century. He describes his\n                grandparents, their personalities, and their influences on him. He describes his\n                experiences during World War II (WWII) and recounts his duties a volunteer ambulance\n                driver with the American Field Service in northern Africa and the Middle East. He\n                compares the experiences of soldiers during WWII and those who served in the Vietnam\n                War, and the impressions he had of how American civilians perceived the experiences\n                of soldiers and civilians living in countries affected by the war. He explains that\n                after his service in the war, he decided to take time to decide what career he\n                wanted for himself. He recounts his experiences between 1944 and 1948, traveling\n                throughout the United States, working on farms, and learning about different\n                religions. He describes a spiritual experience he had during WWII in Syria, and his\n                interest in Buddhism, Islam, and mystical parts of Judaism. He explains how this\n                experience inspired him to serve the spiritual needs of people and his belief at the\n                time that this would not be possible in established Protestant churches. He recounts\n                taking courses at the Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan in 1945. He discusses\n                his work as a farm laborer in different areas of the United States between 1945 and\n                1948 and studying in New York City during the winters. He recounts enrolling full\n                time at the Seminary, working in East Harlem, and joining the East Harlem Protestant\n                Parish and moving to East Harlem in 1949. He describes the sense of community he\n                witnessed in East Harlem amongst the Puerto Rican, African American, Eastern\n                European, and Italian residents of the neighborhood. He explains that while everyone\n                was aware of the ways in which their neighbors were different from them, they were\n                connected by the fact that they were neighbors and lived together. He discusses the\n                work of the Metro North Citizens' Committee and the Parish to ensure the residents\n                of the neighborhood had adequate housing. He discusses the ways in which public\n                housing projects positively and negatively affected the community and compares them\n                to the tenements they replaced."

The narrators include residents of the East Harlem neighborhood of\n            Manhattan, New York; Asian American activists; Central American, African, and Caribbean\n            immigrants who settled in New York City in the 1980s and 1990s; members of the Three\n            Arrows Cooperative Society in Putnam Valley, New York; and residents of public and\n            cooperative housing in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. The narrators who\n            lived in East Harlem were members of the East Harlem Protestant Parish, stickball\n            players, or were involved with the Young Lords activist organization. The East Harlem\n            Protestant Parish interviews cover the founding of the church and its work in East\n            Harlem. The stickball interviews contain discussions of different forms of stickball\n            popular in East Harlem through the 1940s and 1960s and amateur and professional\n            stickball teams in New York City from the 1940s to the time of the interview. The\n            interviews conducted with Asian American activists cover their participation in\n            political and social movements, including Asian Americans for Action, Harlem Parents'\n            Committee, and the Organization on African American Unity. These interviews include\n            discussions of the narrators' experiences in the internment camps in the western United\n            States (US) during World War II and of discrimination. The interviews with Central\n            American, African, and Caribbean immigrants include discussions of immigration\n            experiences, comparisons of life in the US and the narrators' countries of origins, and\n            discrimination experienced by the narrators in the US. The majority of the Central\n            American narrators were Nicaraguan or lived in Nicaragua in the 1970s and 1980s, and\n            relate their experiences of the Nicaraguan Revolution between 1979 and 1990. The members\n            of the Three Arrows Cooperative Society (3A) in Putnam Valley, New York describe the\n            community and its principles and their participation other political and social\n            organizations, including the Young People's Socialist League and the Workmen's Circle.\n            The Young Lords interviews discuss the history and activities of the organization in New\n            York City in the 1970s and 1980s."
